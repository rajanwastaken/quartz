One is by the sword. The other is by debt.”  - John Adams, 1826</p><p>In 1989, Chinese revolutionary leader Deng Xiaoping pioneered the nation’s rapid industrialization and transition from an agrarian society. His efforts in trade liberalization accelerated China’s economy to grow nearly 10% annually, join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and eventually become the largest economy by GDP in 2017. To this day, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) remains to be the largest growing economy, as well as being the only country to increase in GDP in 2020 after the outbreak of COVID-19. However, as an emerging superpower, China’s means of rapid growth has been put into question. Geostrategist Brahma Chellaney depicts China’s rapid industrialization as facilitated through high-volume debt to developing countries to gain sovereignty and geopolitical advantage. Chellaney coins this narrative as ‘debt-trap diplomacy’, highlighting a foreign policy approach that uses high levels of debt to blackmail countries into acceding to policy demands in favour of the benefactor. He claims that this debt is exchanged with increased industrialization projects and external sovereignty of resource-rich regions, notably northern Africa. The existence of this theory has been debated since its introduction in 2017, prompting me to investigate: to what extent has the evolution of Africa-China relations since 2013 discredited the presence of ‘debt-trap diplomacy’? </p><p>Investigating the existence of this theory, between the 2014 and 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflicts, can be explored through the lens of multilateralism, military intervention and the recovery from economic inflation. First, the western emphasis on sanctions significantly reduced support for African economic growth, opening new opportunities for multilateral trade between China and Africa. Initiatives like the Belt-Road and free trade agreements are demonstrative of China’s commitment to becoming an international power. Second, the African governments’ focus on sustainability compromised their internal sovereignty; Africa’s reliance on funding and resources have rapidly increased as a result of these conflicts, posing new opportunities for loans inflicted by Chinese governments. It is argued that military intervention through peacekeeping and peacebuilding are employed to create sustainable infrastructure for long-term development, instead of short-term debt traps. Finally, both Russia and Ukraine make up the majority of Africa’s wheat exports, thus creating worldwide food shortages and inflation during the war; as northern Africa’s resources deplete, their governments sought partnerships with the PRC. Here, strategies for economic sustainability were employed and debt was considered to be an inevitable consequence, instead of a political advantage. Ultimately, understanding these contexts allow for a stronger understanding of China’s sustainable and relational motivations in northern Africa.</p><p>Power is the ability to activate change through authority and control, instead of being seen as a unitary force. This investigation is deeply connected to the concept of relational power, which is the relative power a nation-state has over another; this is indicative of a network of nations that interact in order to gain power. Instead of understanding it as material capacity, relational power emphasizes the way in which material resources are distributed. The fundamental tenet is that the material value of a nation, albeit military or economic, only has a value when there are multiple actors establishing a relationship surrounding its distribution. This provokes an investigation into whether China and Africa interact through a hierarchical dependency or a mutual relationship. </p><p>There are further connections to sustainability and peace. Sustainability, more specifically sustainable development, refers to advancements made to accelerate the present state of society without compromising the future. Development, analyzed through patterns of deprivation and measured through economic success, is influenced in the face of internal changes to political power and shifts in external sovereignty. In the context of trade liberalization and export orientation, the changes in development are indicative of the stability and relational success of a nation-state. Furthermore, peace is the absence of overt violence at internal and external settings through political systems, power distribution and diplomatic resolution. Here, positive peace investigates the measures that aim to sustain peace beyond the elimination of conflict; efforts to maintain this positive peace vary between social, military and economic means. Cumulatively, investigating China’s role in peacebuilding reflects their interest in maintaining a relationship with Africa, or whether this is an independent movement for rapid industrialization. </p><p>To evaluate the presence of debt-trap diplomacy, shifts in the knowledge economy, trade agreements and global metrics in the context of neoliberal theories will be representative of China’s influence in the sustainability of northern Africa. Further, UN peacemaking with international actors and peacekeeping interventions reflect China’s motivations in engaging with the continent during this time period. Analyzing both effects required primary and secondary sources, such that primary sources were found through interviews and perspectives. All possible sources of bias were considered and evaluated.</p><a href=#power-through-multilateralism-to-globalize-trade><h2 id=power-through-multilateralism-to-globalize-trade><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>Power through Multilateralism to Globalize Trade</h2></a><p>Through the use of multilateral interactions and deals, China’s government increased engagement with north African powers to enable continental initiatives for trade and retain regional power. The 2014 and 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflicts, which have instigated military and political realignments, weakened the western domination of African affairs and introduced new possibilities for multilateral cooperation between China and north Africa. Smart power measures by the European Union and United States eroded the Russian government’s ability to finance a war, including economic, cyber and geopolitical sanctions every year since 2014, culminating to 663 personal sanctions on Russian oligarchs and 729 multilateral sanctions. With the influx of foreign sanctions, however, the United States and other western powers prioritized breaking ties with primary forces involved in the attack and, by extension, strained their foreign relations with critical markets such as Africa. In 2014, following the first Russia-Ukraine conflict, US trade with Sub-Saharan Africa reduced from USD $75B to USD $25B, the petroleum market decreased six-fold and African exports surpassed American exports for the first time in the 21st century. As mentioned by political economist David Ricardo, nations that “&mldr;lost part of [their] trade, could not retain the same quantity of circulating medium which it before possessed.” The Western emphasis on sanctions limited their relational power with African markets, thus opening new opportunities for Chinese trade through multilateralism, as illustrated through recent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) metrics.</p><p><img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/x8mFOWcJosV8gX6gK39E4TgT571YCyiW7rBXk816s_dY-QlN55t-X3SbXnSLw9m9oCqc-1ElVHbCgcmOf7msfmFKf6KfhIw8ZBWNffFlZZn5l1INhZp1Rnb5-6cNqrQiEThQ2v0nXWNftgSzwwxFu3u-gP8YiyNinTU6t_cP25VHH0e-xQv1WUu5STuHsw width=auto alt></p><p>Figure 1: </p><p>Debt-trap diplomacy claims that China drastically increased engagement with Africa to implement high-scale infrastructure at a low cost; the lack of Western involvement in African countries following the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict put Africa’s globalization at risk, resulting in high volume loans by China. However, President of the PRC Xi Jinping claims that the majority of the world’s problems are not rooted in overly integrated economies, but rather the lack of economic globalization. To restore Africa’s role on the global stage, China drastically increased their multilateral involvement with Sub-Saharan communities to promote sustainable development, instead of accumulating debt. Both nations, as signatories of the Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation, are part of the ‘community of states’ that demonstrate their commitment in supporting the ‘third world’. The first signs of change in Africa emerged in 2015, when the president of the African Union (AU) launched a ‘golden era’ of relations. In this time, an influx of bilateral trade between the nations emerged, which was representative of mutual growth, not hierarchical dependency. The most prominent example during this period has been the onset of the Belt Road Initiative, the emergence of a trans-Asia network of trade routes spanning for 6400 kilometers that was representative of relational power through the shared power of resources to aim in globalization. This initiative discredits the existence of debt trap diplomacy through two factors. First, as senior economist S.M. Shafaeddin mentions, trade liberalization is the act that would neutralize a trade regime beyond the scope of government intervention. He extends this argument through export orientation</p><p>In light of this new opportunity, China drastically increased engagement with Africa to implement high-scale infrastructure at a low cost; the lack of Western engagement enabled the formation of loans for development throughout the continent. The China Africa Research Initiative, a study completed by the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in 2021, spotlights the inverse relationship between Chinese FDI and US FDI to Africa following a point of influx between 2012 and 2014.</p><p>**</p></div></div></article><div class=page-end id=footer><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://rajanwastaken.github.io/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Built by Rajan Agarwal with Quartz</p><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://rajanwastaken.github.io/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/rajanwastaken>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rajanwastaken>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
