1. How was Edison’s approach to science and innovation different to Tesla’s?

Approaches to science, for Eddison and Tesla, became congruent with approaches to social systems. Tesla, who was "[insistent] on solitude" was living life on innovation. Pure ideas became his adrenaline, so he thrived off of independent reflection. Edison, on the other hand, realized that "genius loves company" — in the presence of other thinkers, then ideas can become tangible realities without concern for limits. Tesla believed that innovation required carefully cultivated ideation, something inherent to the creator and only possible to carry through by the only person that can truly understand: oneself. While isolation is considered to be ineffective, Tesla's tech was unequivocally superior. The most suitable approach that remains to this day, community-focused creation, was Edison's key to rapid success and allowed him to approach and tackle problems that lead to the most efficient and effective results. Tesla had groundbreaking tech, Edison had a team that scaled ideas beyond the time's imagination.


2. What was the result of this - for both men?

Edison used his community of builders to design the best possible product; Tesla experimented in great detail until he perfected his tech. In the creation of the lightbulb, a community-first effort led to the efficient discovery of a pear-shaped bulb, which conserved the most energy and produced a lasting glow — something that Edison could not figure out himself. While this was the most effective and quickest method, Edison's fame may be put to question due to the high influence of his team. Tesla's fame lies in deeply rooted experimentation and knowledge, during his work to discover the AC motor and transmission technology. Technologically, both men found fame and success in their innovations, through leadership and solitude.
