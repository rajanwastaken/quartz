This week, in our TOK class, we watched a documentary called *The Rachel Divide*, featuring a woman who identified as Black although she was born to two white parents. 





How does the way that we organize or classify knowledge affect what we know?

- In our English class, we watched a documentary called **The Rachel Divide**, a spin off of the phrase *racial divide* — it featured a woman who identified herself as Black, although she was born with two white parents. Regardless of her biological race, she felt that she belonged in the African American community, and made it her point to express herself as such. 
- The documentary, while illustrative of the context and facts, was presented against her favour — it was edited so illustrate arguments for as somber and arguments against as triumphant.
- In the production of new knowledge, often where this knowledge is one of the only sources, its organization can shift the bias of the viewer to align with the bias of the editor/creator. How can we determine the credibility of new knowledge? What factors, within bias, affect our understanding of new knowledge?
