## Questions

1. State the title of the film and the year it was released.  Then briefly describe what the film is about and the position that it advocates. 

The Rachel Divide was filmed and published in 2018, taking on the challenge of analyzing Rachel Dolezal's conflicting identity — and more importantly, her expression of this identity. The documentary takes into consideration her family's perspectives and that of the NCAAP, questioning whether her consideration as a black woman was justified. 

 2.  Describe the progression of the film: how it begins, what stages it passes through, and how it concludes.

The film begins with the context under which Rachel's life and identity was exposed, where her and her son were put in the face of danger. Rachel was exposed during the increasing amount of police brutality that existed in her community — she mentioned how her identity was shaped by her *oppressive childhood.*

3. List six facts described in the film that impressed you and explain how each fact relates to the film’s premise or theme. 
	1. Rachel felt a strong connection to Black heritage and people of the African-American community.
	2. As of 2018, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by _police_ during their lifetime
	3. She grew up in an abusive household. Her parents, Larry and Ruthann, are described as religious extremists who faced severe consequences.
	4. She is facing financial struggles and is, by extension, being discredited by African-Americans that are facing the same issues as a result of prejudice.

4.   How did the filmmakers try to convince you of the position that the film supports? Look for appeals to logic, emotion, and prejudice. 

Large emphasis on news articles and varying types of media that went against her point. For all the arguemnts she brought up, which were limited to the editor's perspective, she was perceived to be crazy and delusional. Directly juxtaposed credible sources and personal anecdotes to her opinion. During points against her, there is usually triumphant music and a quick pace, while her arguments face somber music and very slow imagery

5. Did any of the reasoning given in support of the position advocated by the film seem to be weak or misleading?  If so, describe the concept put forward in the film and why you thought the reasoning was flawed.



6.  Describe any cinematic techniques used in presenting particular scenes, images, or sounds that were designed to appeal to the viewer’s emotions and to encourage the viewer to agree with the position advocated by the film, without reliance upon fact or logical argument.

7.   If the filmmakers asked how this film could be improved, what would you tell them?  Describe the changes you would suggest in detail.

8. Did the film change your mind about any aspect of the subject that it presents? What information, argument or persuasive technique caused you to change your mind?

9. Can you make any connections to a Global Issue? How so? Which literary work studied in the course can you connect this documentary to?
