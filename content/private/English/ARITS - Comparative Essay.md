#### Feminism
Feminism is a perspective that views [gender](https://www.123helpme.com/topics/gender) as one of the most important bases of the structure and organization of the social world. Feminists argue that in most known societies this structure has granted women lower status and value, more limited access to valuable resources, and less autonomy and opportunity to make choices over their lives than it has granted men

Beneatha’s conviction to her modernized worldview highlights her unique brand of strength, perhaps also serving as an indirect expression of Hansberry’s own opinions. Walter’s status as a man parallels both his success as the “man” of the house and his ability to establish himself as an equal in his interactions with Lindner and others.
- Beneatha's *mutilated* hair is a symbol of her culture; quickly stripped away due ot the consequences of the American Dream
- Beneatha is criticized in her atttempts to become a doctor and faces several challenges in her attempt to gain respect
- Marrying a man with *loot* is the idealized scenario for Beneatha, as she is supposed to follow in her parents' footsteps
- Power and authority is associated with being the *head of the house* and this role changes based on socioeconomic factors
- Motherhood & taking care gets in the way of dreams; criticized for being realists
- Women are told that *a man needs a woman to back him*, solidifying their secondary role — *for a woman, taking care of a man should be enough*

#### Racism / Oppression
After moving to a house in an all-white neighbourhood, Hansberry’s family endured legal battles and physical threats not unlike the “bombs” that Walter, Ruth, and Mrs. Johnson reference in the play. Despite the suggestion by Karl Lindner that “race prejudice simply doesn't enter into” Clybourne Park’s offer to buy back the Youngers’ home, he hints at the very real dangers that accompany the family’s decision to relocate to a white neighbourhood.

### Exemplar Response


The play A Raisin in the Sun, by Lorraine Hansberry, and the graphic novel Persepolis, by Marjane Satrapi, tell the misinterpreted stories of two communities in different parts of the world. This response seeks to explore both texts from a Feminist lens, comparing and contrasting how each work depicts the global struggle of women’s education. Hansberry wrote A Raisin in the Sun at a time when she was facing a similar strife herself, allowing her to craft the story to meticulously reflect reality. The authenticity of the play encourages the audience to empathize with each character’s story, one of which being Beneatha’s difficulties with her education. Satrapi, similarly, presents the experiences she has gone through by narrating Persepolis as a coming-of-age story - commencing and ending with her time in educational institutions. Satrapi’s structuring of the graphic novel accentuates the pivotal role that education plays in Marji’s life; an emphasis is brought to how it is a common thread running through a myriad of her adversities. Throughout both texts, the theme of women’s struggle with education is explored through the symbolic portrayal of main characters and bookending structure.

Lorraine Hansberry curates each character in her play to represent a different facet of the African-American’s experience in America during the 1950’s, an example being Beneatha who symbolizes adversity, progression, and rebellion. A Raisin in the Sun spotlights a family of vastly different members, each undergoing their own journey and bound together by their shared financial situation. Beneatha, a Black woman who falls under two minority groups, is in college studying medicine - an anomaly in American society at the time of this play. The adversities she faces as a result of her identity are foreshadowed through her name, Beneatha, which is an extension of the word beneath. Names being an integral component of one’s identity, the rebellious character possessing a name with its origins in a word negatively connoted, sets the foundation for all the struggles she will face as a result of who she is. Furthermore, Hansberry distinguishes Beneatha’s character as one reflecting progression in societal thoughts and systems. This paves the way for a deeper exploration of how systemic structures - such as the geographical and financial inaccessibility of schools - bar women from attaining a standard level education. Additionally, Beneatha is shown as a fearless and outspoken woman through repeatedly delivering her dialogue in a tone of heightened urgency. By bringing attention to how strong Beneatha is, the audience is posed with the question of why it is necessary for her to display such ferocity; the failures of society in educating women - Black women specifically - are brought to light.

Marjane Sitrapi’s structuring of the book, last chapter, and panels, brings emphasis to the role of education in Marji’s life. The story centers around Marji’s life in Iran during the Iranian Revolution, and how the violent and extremist climate impacted her childhood growing up. Seen in the first chapter, and once again in the last, is the fact that the receiving of a holistic education is denied to Marji and contributes to the strife in her life. By bookending the story with this common theme, Sitrapi draws attention to the tumultuous nature of her school years, further deepening the devastation evoked within readers. The emotive structure of the book allows for readers to empathize with the gravity of the issue Sitrapi depicts. Furthermore, the last chapter focuses on how Marji’s struggle with a censored curriculum forces her to leave the country entirely. The structure of the chapter is set so that it transitions from a massive fight between Marji and her teacher at the beginning, to the scene of her departure from her home. The effectiveness of this structure lies in its cause and effect transitions, where the readers see not only the struggles Marji faces in regards to her schooling, but also the repercussions of them; the message of her adversities is thus conveyed well through the specific authorial choice of choosing the last chapter to reflect a full circle moment with her education. Moreover, the specific panels within this chapter show resentment through the facial expressions of the characters, allowing readers to grasp the frustrations felt by Marji and the true depth of her struggles. The furrowed eyebrows depict an aggression that is seen both literally and figuratively. Each character in the scene is emotionally charged, heightening the risk associated with Marji’s rebellion against the educational institutions. In portraying the vitality of the moment through intense confrontations, Sitrapi efficiently infuses the story with a theme of women’s struggle in education.

A Raisin in the Sun and Persepolis, both, depict the struggles with education that women face through the authors’ intentional character depictions and text structures. A common link shared between Beneatha and Marji is how their ambition creates a situation where they rebel against their community’s expectations. Beneatha does not listen to her family who is trying to persuade her to give up, and Marji does not listen to her school which is trying to convince her of the fallacy of her beliefs. Both characters desire to challenge the systems that limit them, and do so by continuing to tune the voice of their society out. Though Hansberry and Sitrapi share similarities in their portrayal of these characters, the foundation of which these stories are built, contrast greatly. A Raisin in the Sun revolves around the life of a family collectively, within the span of a few months - allowing readers to zone in on the microscale repercussions of Beneatha’s struggles with education. Meanwhile, Persepolis spans over a time period of around two decades; readers are able to grasp the larger consequences of Marji’s turbulent schooling. Thus, it can be seen that both A Raisin in the Sun and Persepolis, while being texts of entirely separate forms, convey the universality and pertinence of exploring women’s education and lack-there-of.
