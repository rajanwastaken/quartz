> altruistic, adventurous, angelic or aglow — we are abstract, by nature.
> 
> abstractionism is at the core of individualism, platonism is at the core of identity.
> true curiosity into how we work and how we feel is the foundation of the modernity and adaptability that makes up who we are. and more importantly, who we aspire to be. this is a story: of abstractionism, of identity and of hope. we are all **platonists**, as we embrace the abstractionism that makes up our increasingly interconnected world.
> 
> platonism affirms the existence of the abstract nature that exists in a third realm distinct from the sensible and conscious world, contrasting everything we know about nominalism.
> 
> in order to avoid the endless sequence of monochromatic ideologies and opinions, we must first embrace being abstract.
>
> a world without support for mental health is a world we do not want to live in. we must support the people we love around us. our identity is what makes us unique—why blend in, when humans were designed to stand out?
>
> this is a story about platonism—the basis of what makes us different. this is what brings identity to the hidden and shelter to the exposed. this is **the platonist.**
