This page is under construction. In the meantime, read this short summary of the work I completed locally and globally:



We were challenged to find one political issue in our community and create an actionable solution. As a volunteer at my local food bank, I explored our city’s rapidly rising rates of food insecurity, regardless of our urban and democratic status. I discovered that most funding was towards food banks, instead of the foundational issue: the price of food. Here, I took initiative to address the issue locally, nationally and globally. Locally, I worked directly with food banks across the city to implement cost-saving strategies and distribute a digital petition — one that reached 200+ signatures. I booked meetings with our local Federal Member of Parliament and Member of Provincial Parliament; several consultations later, I was personally directed to the Ontario Ministry of Health, where I presented the petition and shared my pitch for new means of food distribution. I continued conversations that led to many others in the area, most notably PROOF Canada, an interdisciplinary research program addressing household food insecurity, to lobby for change.

To this end, I extended my learning to a digital internship in Bauchi, Nigeria, where I hosted virtual community workshops in their city and generated a report for my school and community leaders. Here, I applied my knowledge of internal sovereignty and hybrid regimes in discussion with local members of government. Through these connections, I worked directly with the Nagari Medical Clinic & Maternity Ward that helped draw parallels between systems of capitalism around the world. Here, I developed my repertoire of theory and political practice in search of a more universal answer to problems often neglected in the world—problems like sustainable development.
