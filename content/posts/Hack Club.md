This summer, I got the opportunity to work with [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) to redesign their application flow. This would handle all new applications for students to start a Hack Club at their own schools, connecting students with delegates from around the world.

My intention in this platform was storytelling. People should understand what Hack Club is, their core values and why applying was the right choice.
