Pseudosciences are disciplines, fields or beliefs that claim to offer systematic knowledge about the natural world, but which are not based on the scientific method. 

**When testing a theory, do we wish to prove it or disprove it?**

- If solely using pseudoscience, then one will face confirmation bias
- False beliefs are good, as it gets is *this much* closer to believing true things
