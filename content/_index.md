I seek serendipity in code, craft & curiosity. My passion for software is rooted in building [[posts/Projects|platforms and infrastructure]] that can be used by [[posts/hack club|millions of people]], while meeting wonderful people along the way. Currently, I'm building [[posts/Arterial]] to build better cities at scale.

On the side, I'm independently researching [[posts/thoughtful interfaces|interfaces]], [[posts/Maximizing Solar Energy|sustainable energy systems]] and [[posts/Evolutionary Game Theory|evolutionary game theory models]]. Previously, I've worked as a Software Engineer at [[posts/camp social|Camp Social]] to rethink digital communities and built [[posts/ConnexSci]] to materialize early-stage research.

Within my community, I'm tackling [[posts/Food Insecurity|food insecurity]] within governments, enabling [[posts/Financial Literacy|financial literacy]] in youth and maximizing [[posts/Food Insecurity|community involvement]].

Globally, I helped [[posts/ChoiceDAO|raise $20,000USD for reproductive access]], worked with teams to [[posts/camp social|restore interconnectedness on the internet]] and engineered new systems to [[posts/hack club|help teens learn how to code]].

In my free time, I play and write [[posts/Sovereignty|music]], write [[posts/Poetry to Image Models|poetry]], take [[posts/Photography|photos]] and work on my novel, [[posts/The Platonist]].
