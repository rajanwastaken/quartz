Welcome! I'm Rajan, a developer and independent researcher engineering intricate systems and crafting thoughtful tools. My passion for software is rooted in building platforms and infrastructure that can be used by [[posts/hack club|millions of people]], while meeting wonderful people along the way. Currently, I'm building [Arterial](https://arterial.design) to help build better cities at scale.

I believe that knowledge should be connected through networks. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [[posts/camp-social|Camp Social]] and built [[posts/ConnexSci|ConnexSci]]. Now, I'm researching [[posts/thoughtful interfaces|interfaces]], [[posts/maximizing solar energy|climate]] and [[posts/Evolutionary Game Theory|health]] systems and models. 

Globally, I helped [[posts/choicedao|raise $20,000USD for reproductive access]] and engineered new systems to [[posts/hack club|help teens learn how to code]]. Within my community, I'm tackling [[posts/Food Insecurity|food insecurity]] within governments, enabling [financial literacy](https://jectoronto.org) in youth and maximizing [[posts/Food Insecurity|community involvement]].

In my free time, I play and compose [music](https://rajan.sh), write [poetry](https://rajan.sh), take [[posts/Photography|photos]] and work on my [[posts/The Platonist|novel]].

I'm always interested in meeting new people â€” find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajanwastaken), [Curius](https://curius.app/rajan-agarwal) and [Github](https://github.com/rajanwastaken).
