I seek serendipity in code, craft & curiosity. My passion for software is rooted in his interest of building platforms and infrastructure that can be used by millions of people, while meeting wonderful people along the way. Currently, I'm building [[posts/Arterial]] to design better cities at scale.

On the side, I'm independently researching [[posts/Community Interfaces|community interfaces]], [[posts/Maximizing Solar Energy|sustainable energy systems]] and [[posts/Evolutionary Game Theory|evolutionary game theory models]]. Previously, I've worked as a Software Engineer at [[posts/Camp Social]] to restore humanity on the internet and built [[projects/ConnexSci]] to materialize research in the drug discovery space.

Within my community, I'm tackling [[posts/Food Insecurity]] within governments, enabling [[posts/Financial Literacy|financial literacy]] in youth and maximizing [[posts/Food Insecurity|community involvement]].

Globally, I helped [[posts/ChoiceDAO|raise $20,000USD for reproductive access]], worked with teams to [[posts/Camp Social|restore interconnectedness on the internet]] and engineered new systems to [[posts/Hack Club|help teens learn how to code]].

In my free time, I play and write [[posts/Sovereignty|music]], write [[posts/Poetry to Image Models|poetry]], take [[posts/Photography|photos]] and work on my novel, [[posts/The Platonist]].
