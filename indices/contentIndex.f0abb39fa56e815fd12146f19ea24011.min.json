Worry, doubt, self-distrust and fear; these are the long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit back to dust.

State the title of the film and the year it was released.  Then briefly describe what the film is about and the position that it advocates. \n\nThe Rachel Divide was filmed and published in 2018, taking on the challenge of analyzing Rachel Dolezal's conflicting identity — and more importantly, her expression of this identity. The documentary takes into consideration her family's perspectives and that of the NCAAP, questioning whether her consideration as a black woman was justified. \n\n 2.  Describe the progression of the film: how it begins, what stages it passes through, and how it concludes.\n\nThe film begins with the context under which Rachel's life and identity was exposed, where her and her son were put in the face of danger. Rachel was exposed during the increasing amount of police brutality that existed in her community — she mentioned how her identity was shaped by her *oppressive childhood.*\n\n3. List six facts described in the film that impressed you and explain how each fact relates to the film’s premise or theme. \n\t1. Rachel felt a strong connection to Black heritage and people of the African-American community.\n\t2. As of 2018, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by _police_ during their lifetime\n\t3. She grew up in an abusive household. Her parents, Larry and Ruthann, are described as religious extremists who faced severe consequences.\n\t4. She is facing financial struggles and is, by extension, being discredited by African-Americans that are facing the same issues as a result of prejudice.\n\n4.   How did the filmmakers try to convince you of the position that the film supports? Look for appeals to logic, emotion, and prejudice. \n\nLarge emphasis on news articles and varying types of media that went against her point. For all the arguemnts she brought up, which were limited to the editor's perspective, she was perceived to be crazy and delusional. Directly juxtaposed credible sources and personal anecdotes to her opinion. During points against her, there is usually triumphant music and a quick pace, while her arguments face somber music and very slow imagery\n\n5. Did any of the reasoning given in support of the position advocated by the film seem to be weak or misleading?  If so, describe the concept put forward in the film and why you thought the reasoning was flawed.\n\n6.  Describe any cinematic techniques used in presenting particular scenes, images, or sounds that were designed to appeal to the viewer’s emotions and to encourage the viewer to agree with the position advocated by the film, without reliance upon fact or logical argument.\n\n7.   If the filmmakers asked how this film could be improved, what would you tell them?  Describe the changes you would suggest in detail.\n\n8. Did the film change your mind about any aspect of the subject that it presents? What information, argument or persuasive technique caused you to change your mind?\n\n9. Can you make any connections to a Global Issue? How so? Which literary work studied in the course can you connect this documentary to? \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T20:30:08.505281441Z","tags":null},"/notes/school/tok/pseudoscience":{"title":"Pseudoscience","content":"\nPseudosciences are disciplines, fields or beliefs that claim to offer systematic knowledge about the natural world, but which are not based on the scientific method. \n\n**When testing a theory, do we wish to prove it or disprove it?**\n- Only seeking to disprove a theory to truly disprove it\n- If solely using pseudoscience, then one will face confirmation bias\n- False beliefs are good, as it gets is *this much* closer to believing true things\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T20:30:08.505281441Z","tags":null},"/notes/school/tok/relativism":{"title":"Relativism","content":"\n1. How was Edison’s approach to science and innovation different to Tesla’s?\n\nApproaches to science, for Eddison and Tesla, became congruent with approaches to social systems. Tesla, who was \"[insistent] on solitude\" was living life on innovation. Pure ideas became his adrenaline, so he thrived off of independent reflection. Edison, on the other hand, realized that \"genius loves company\" — in the presence of other thinkers, then ideas can become tangible realities without concern for limits. Tesla believed that innovation required carefully cultivated ideation, something inherent to the creator and only possible to carry through by the only person that can truly understand: oneself. While isolation is considered to be ineffective, Tesla's tech was unequivocally superior. The most suitable approach that remains to this day, community-focused creation, was Edison's key to rapid success and allowed him to approach and tackle problems that lead to the most efficient and effective results. Tesla had groundbreaking tech, Edison had a team that scaled ideas beyond the time's imagination.\n\n\n2. What was the result of this - for both men?\n\nEdison used his community of builders to design the best possible product; Tesla experimented in great detail until he perfected his tech. In the creation of the lightbulb, a community-first effort led to the efficient discovery of a pear-shaped bulb, which conserved the most energy and produced a lasting glow — something that Edison could not figure out himself. While this was the most effective and quickest method, Edison's fame may be put to question due to the high influence of his team. Tesla's fame lies in deeply rooted experimentation and knowledge, during his work to discover the AC motor and transmission technology. Technologically, both men found fame and success in their innovations, through leadership and solitude.\n\n\u003e \"Learning happens int he minds and souls, not in the databases of multiple-choice tests\" - Ken Robinson\n\n- The arts are victims of this mentality, proposing the aesthetic experience when senses are operating at their peak\n- Getting children through education by anaesthetizing them\n- How do we measure the potential of human beings?\n- \tEconomic wealth\n- \tAbility to apply knowledge under stress","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T20:30:08.505281441Z","tags":null},"/private/School/ARITS-Comparative-Essay":{"title":"ARITS - Comparative Essay","content":"\n#### Feminism\nBeneatha’s conviction to her modernized worldview highlights her unique brand of strength, perhaps also serving as an indirect expression of Hansberry’s own opinions.
