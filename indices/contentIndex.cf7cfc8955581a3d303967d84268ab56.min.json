State the title of the film and the year it was released.  Then briefly describe what the film is about and the position that it advocates. \n\nTell Me Who I am was a documentary released in 2019, detailing the lives of two twins following a major motorcycle accident which caused one twin to lose their memory to its entirety. \n\n 2.  Describe the progression of the film: how it begins, what stages it passes through, and how it concludes.\n\nAct I\n- Begins with distressful music that sets the scene of the original accident\n- Use for first-person view and close ups to immerse the viewer into the experience, to identify the shock that was associated with this event\n- He only remember ed his brother, not his mother or anyone else. He began to forget his own life — the use of music accentuated the shock of the experience\n- His brother was the only person he could trust, and Alex felt like he was alone in the world. Marcus helped him with everything in recreating the memories\n- As Alex wanted to explore his identity in more depth, he began to get more and more curious of his past, questioning things about their family and experience together\n- Alex was normalized to the idea of having distant parents and difficult living conditions — nothing to compare it to. \n- Marcus's reaction to the death of their parents greatly differed from Alex, raising questions as to the characters and relationships made with the twins\n- Alex realized that the one person that he could trust was lying to him, creating an emotional barrier with his only contact with reality.\n\nAct II\n- Alex is curious of his experiences with the family\n- Viewers are posed with the question of trust — if you only have one person to trust in your life, what would happen if they broke this trust?\n- Discovery of their past of sexual abuse from their mother and the image with the top cut off\n- Marcus began to lie for his own sanity, he could not reveal the truth as it would hurt him to the core\n- Difficult for Marcus to stop lying as the false reality has gone on for too long\n- Lying to Alex caused emotional damage, regardless of the fact that the truth would have scarred him as he was re-introduced to the new world\n- It was revealed that the mother sexually abused her sons throughout their childhood, Marcus chose to hide this for the sake of Alex's sanity\n- Marcus did not discuss his past for 20 years\n\nAct III\n- Older Marcus and Alex reconvene and have the discussion they wished they had at a young age\n- Use of visuals and music in conjunction with flashbacks build suspense\n- Marcus claims that he was lying for himself — he was trying to share the life he wish he had\n- Now that the lie has been removed, the bed from the first Act is shined upon with music to convey relief\n\n\n3. List six facts described in the film that impressed you and explain how each fact relates to the film’s premise or theme. \n\n\t1. Alex was able to maintain his proficiency in english and daily habits, but not remember people — raised questions of inquiry into what happened following the accident\n\t2. The two boys were sexually abused at a young age, and this trauma was unclear for both of them. This uncertainty of these situations increased the suspense and worry in the viewers, raising questions as to the harsh realities of their childhood\n\t3. A lot of the abuse towards the children remained hidden due to their dyslexia, making it difficult for them to communicate verbally and through writing. The twins, as a result, used their personal encounters to develop a connection\n\t4. The twins' step siblings was rarely mentioned in the documentary, which makes the audience question whether they were sexually abused as well.\n\t5. It was only until after their mother died that Alex discovered the sexual abuse as a child, highlighting the restrictive nature of their interactions.\n\t6. Until the age of 14, both boys were involved in a series of sexual abuse cases with her mother's friends and those around her. The tragedy, which lasted for the majority of their childhood, was difficult to convey and thus he kept it to himself. Alex's unabashed curiosity eventually destroys his understanding of his past and trust of Alex.\n\n4.   How did the filmmakers try to convince you of the position that the film supports? Look for appeals to logic, emotion, and prejudice. \n\nThe film is not solely about the accident; it is a reflection on the long-lasting repercussions of sexual assault, the complex issue of \"good\" lies, and the moral conundrum that results from suppressing distressing truth. The use of key symbols like the bed and the personalized experience from editing helps the audience understand the trauma through an appeal to emotion. \n\n5. Did any of the reasoning given in support of the position advocated by the film seem to be weak or misleading?  If so, describe the concept put forward in the film and why you thought the reasoning was flawed.\n\nThe audience is made to fill in the blanks of many parts of the film. It often goes between the age of 18 to 30 to 60, which forces the viewer to make connections to what happens in this gap. \n\n6.  Describe any cinematic techniques used in presenting particular scenes, images, or sounds that were designed to appeal to the viewer’s emotions and to encourage the viewer to agree with the position advocated by the film, without reliance upon fact or logical argument.\n\nRe-Enactment: key household items and parts of their childhood were recreated to share an insightful take on their past\n\nFlashback: shared moments from their past are displayed again, with archival footage or recreations of childhood moments\n\nLighting: the entirety of the film, until the very last scene, maintains low-key lighting to convey suspense and darkness\n\nMusic: the audio and music are always suspenseful, keeping viewers anticipated and on their toes\n\n7.   If the filmmakers asked how this film could be improved, what would you tell them?  Describe the changes you would suggest in detail.\n\nProvide more context into key parts of their childhood; there is a lot of repetition between Alex and Marcus who sometimes have the same take on a certain issue or a piece of their past. \n\nAnalyze the perspectives of those they interacted with in their lives. Exploring the lives of their step sisters or close friends may provide more insight into how his memory loss was perceived.\n\n8. Did the film change your mind about any aspect of the subject that it presents? What information, argument or persuasive technique caused you to change your mind?\n\nThe documentary, although not trying to prove a point, helped gain more insight into the varying perspectives. Upon my first interaction with Marcus's choices, I was shocked to see that he hid the truth for more than a decade. However, as the film progressed, cinematic devices helped understand the risk that Marcus took and to empathize with his situation — he was lying for his own sanity to develop the childhood he wish he had.\n\n9. Can you make any connections to a Global Issue? How so? Which literary work studied in the course can you connect this documentary to? \n\nThe primary issue presented in the documentary is the role of childhood trauma in the progression of one's life. This connects to Persepolis, who faced an authoritarian government in the face of harsh violence towards women. Similarly, in a Rachel Divide, Rachel claims that her childhood abuse was a precursor for the choice of her identity.","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/notes/school/english/The-Rachel-Divide-Viewing-Guide":{"title":"Rachel Divide Vieweing Guide","content":"\n\n### Questions\n\n1. State the title of the film and the year it was released.  Then briefly describe what the film is about and the position that it advocates. \n\nThe Rachel Divide was filmed and published in 2018, taking on the challenge of analyzing Rachel Dolezal's conflicting identity — and more importantly, her expression of this identity. The documentary takes into consideration her family's perspectives and that of the NCAAP, questioning whether her consideration as a black woman was justified. \n\n 2.  Describe the progression of the film: how it begins, what stages it passes through, and how it concludes.\n\nThe film begins with the context under which Rachel's life and identity was exposed, where her and her son were put in the face of danger. Rachel was exposed during the increasing amount of police brutality that existed in her community — she mentioned how her identity was shaped by her *oppressive childhood.*\n\nIn news scenes, there is a stronger understanding of the social in-acceptance of her choice. With high media attention, she is faced by social criticism by those in the Black community. During the Facebook Live interview, she is challenged by digital influencers that take offense to her *transracial* identity. She is also challenged by talk shows and news reports, notably The Today Show. On Instagram, her posts often get hate comments — some of which challenge her identity and others her desire for media attention.\n\nTo gain a stronger understanding of the context behind her choice, conversations with her son and family are introduced. Her son is deeply entangled in the issue and feels threatened by the beliefs of her mother. Her parents of birth were disapproving from her switch and found shame in her newfound identity. \n\nThe film ends with her going to the DMV and changing her name from Rachel to Nkechi Amare, and her publicly embracing a false identity.\n\n3. List six facts described in the film that impressed you and explain how each fact relates to the film’s premise or theme. \n\n\t1. Rachel felt a strong connection to Black heritage and people of the African-American community.\n\t2. As of 2018, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by _police_ during their lifetime\n\t3. She grew up in an abusive household. Her parents, Larry and Ruthann, are described as religious extremists who faced severe consequences.\n\t4. She is facing financial struggles and is, by extension, being discredited by African-Americans that are facing the same issues as a result of prejudice.\n\t5. Very limited influence from Dolezal's parents, Franklin's dad and the father of her most recent child — these voices may provide insight into the familial acceptance of her choice\n\t6. Her son was deeply affected by the high amount of media attention, now being turned into a documentary. Dolezal's inability to assess the consequences beyond her own life brought attention to the credibility of her opinions.\n\n4.   How did the filmmakers try to convince you of the position that the film supports? Look for appeals to logic, emotion, and prejudice. \n\nLarge emphasis on news articles and varying types of media that went against her point. For all the arguments she brought up, which were limited to the editor's perspective, she was perceived to be crazy and delusional. Directly juxtaposed credible sources and personal anecdotes to her opinion. During points against her, there is usually triumphant music and a quick pace, while her arguments face somber music and very slow imagery. \n\nMentions of her parents and influencers appeal to prejudice in an attempt to share an impartial take on the consequences of her switch. Mentions of news reports and direct features aim for an appeal to logic by providing credible sources of analysis. Mentions of her son provide an appeal to emotion, through an analysis of how this is affecting the next generation of her family.\n\n5. Did any of the reasoning given in support of the position advocated by the film seem to be weak or misleading?  If so, describe the concept put forward in the film and why you thought the reasoning was flawed.\n\nIn the way that the film was edited, her arguments were often discredited by conveying a constant stream of lies and deceitful thinking on her end. It reached the point where the audience — and the people around her — were unable to trust her anymore. There were a few strong points, however these were quickly contrasted by credible sources or verifiable members of her family. This also applies to a few claims that she made, notable that \"race is a social construct\".\n\n6.  Describe any cinematic techniques used in presenting particular scenes, images, or sounds that were designed to appeal to the viewer’s emotions and to encourage the viewer to agree with the position advocated by the film, without reliance upon fact or logical argument.\n\nRe-Enactment: Visual scenes from her childhood that were recreated for dramatic effects in flashbacks\n\nMontage: during scenes of media attention, the most influential points made were compiled together\n\nEye-Level: documentary created the feeling of speaking directly to Dolezal\n\nLighting: during scenes of rebuttal, there is often high-key lighting to emphasize credibility and reliability. During the somber moments of her discussion, she faced low-key lighting\n\n7.   If the filmmakers asked how this film could be improved, what would you tell them?  Describe the changes you would suggest in detail.\n\nEmphasize more on the personal experiences of those that were affected by her switch. How exactly did this affect the African-American community; what was done in compromise by Dolezal, if anything?\n\nIn discussion of her son, take into consideration his future — does publishing this documentary with more media attention change the course of his future? How will this affect his life?\n\n8. Did the film change your mind about any aspect of the subject that it presents? What information, argument or persuasive technique caused you to change your mind?\n\nAlthough this was a new topic for me, my first interpretation was ridiculing/questioning the viability of this idea. As the film progressed, my opinion did not change much. Instead of sympathizing with Rachel, I took into consideration the direct consequences of her actions, specifically with her son. The emphasis of external views persuaded me to side with the media, and continue my perspective of this being an improper choice.\n\n9. Can you make any connections to a Global Issue? How so? Which literary work studied in the course can you connect this documentary to? \n\nThis strongly resonates with the social stratification involved with racial identity. Connections can be made to Persepolis, where she tries to fit in with Western society, as well as A Raisin in the Sun where racial barriers are precursors for discrimination\n\n---\n\n\n### Post-film Analysis\n\n### Sympathy\n- Private Life (eye-level)\n\t- Family\n\t- Household\n\t- Friends\n- Crying/Frustration\n\t- Frustration within family\n\t- Anecdotes from children; how it's ruining family\n- Emotional/Somber Music\n- Social Media --\u003e negativity\n- Her side of the story/impact on the community\n\n### Opposition\n- Interviews with Black women\n- Facebook/Social Media Interviews \u0026 Opinions\n- News Channels (Clips --\u003e Ethos)\n- Interviews with her Son and frustrations\n- Interviews with biological family ","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/notes/school/tok/TOK-Journal":{"title":"","content":"This week, in our TOK class, we watched a documentary called *The Rachel Divide*, featuring a woman who identified as Black although she was born to two white parents. \n\nHow does the way that we organize or classify knowledge affect what we know?\n\n- In our English class, we watched a documentary called **The Rachel Divide**, a spin off of the phrase *racial divide* — it featured a woman who identified herself as Black, although she was born with two white parents.

How was Edison’s approach to science and innovation different to Tesla’s?\n\nApproaches to science, for Eddison and Tesla, became congruent with approaches to social systems. Tesla, who was \"[insistent] on solitude\" was living life on innovation. Pure ideas became his adrenaline, so he thrived off of independent reflection. Edison, on the other hand, realized that \"genius loves company\" — in the presence of other thinkers, then ideas can become tangible realities without concern for limits. Tesla believed that innovation required carefully cultivated ideation, something inherent to the creator and only possible to carry through by the only person that can truly understand: oneself. While isolation is considered to be ineffective, Tesla's tech was unequivocally superior. The most suitable approach that remains to this day, community-focused creation, was Edison's key to rapid success and allowed him to approach and tackle problems that lead to the most efficient and effective results. Tesla had groundbreaking tech, Edison had a team that scaled ideas beyond the time's imagination.\n\n\n2. What was the result of this - for both men?\n\nEdison used his community of builders to design the best possible product; Tesla experimented in great detail until he perfected his tech. In the creation of the lightbulb, a community-first effort led to the efficient discovery of a pear-shaped bulb, which conserved the most energy and produced a lasting glow — something that Edison could not figure out himself. While this was the most effective and quickest method, Edison's fame may be put to question due to the high influence of his team. Tesla's fame lies in deeply rooted experimentation and knowledge, during his work to discover the AC motor and transmission technology. Technologically, both men found fame and success in their innovations, through leadership and solitude.\n\n\u003e \"Learning happens int he minds and souls, not in the databases of multiple-choice tests\" - Ken Robinson\n\n- The arts are victims of this mentality, proposing the aesthetic experience when senses are operating at their peak\n- Getting children through education by anaesthetizing them\n- How do we measure the potential of human beings?\n- \tEconomic wealth\n- \tAbility to apply knowledge under stress\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/":{"title":"Posts","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Arterial":{"title":"Arterial","content":"\n## Camp Social\n\n### hie\nWrapping up my Internship at Camp Social.\n\n## The Thing\n\nasdf\n\n### Of Course\n\nwhat","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Blind-Spot":{"title":"Blind Spot","content":"\nBlind Spot\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Bloom-Network":{"title":"Bloom Network","content":"\nActive health care.","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Camp-Social":{"title":"My Internship at Camp Social","content":"\n### hie\nWrapping up my Internship at Camp Social.\n\n## The Thing\n\nasdf\n\n### Of Course\n\nwhat","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/ChoiceDAO":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Community-Interfaces":{"title":"Designing Collective Community Interfaces","content":"\nAt my school, clubs develop teams to streamline workflows and produce content as quickly as possible. One of the most common positions was **web and tech**, providing students the opportunity to take technical challenges in designing websites and configuring AV equipment. While websites like these help provide a cohesive set of information for each club, it brings **brand new complications in the communication of new knowledge**.\n\nThis year, for my school, I decided to get rid of the need for separate websites that require high-maintenance and build a cohesive platform for all students. In conversation with several students, there were a few postulates:\n1. This should also act as a club directory. Students want to know what clubs are available and how to learn more about them. This includes a status, descriptions and team details.\n2. Only students with specific email addresses should be allowed to access the platform, as a security issue. It was also recommended to use email-link login to ensure only the user can access their platform.\n3. Club executives should be able to post and manage content as administrators. One could have member access, writing access or administrator access.\n4. Content should be divided **[[thoughts/Atomic Design|atomically]]**. Organizations are divided into repositories, each of which with notebooks consisting of indiviudal posts. \n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117094111.png|Home View]]\n\nThe primary issue with education is that it’s standardized—means for self-study are absolutely critical to turn weekly club lessons into meaningful interactions. Within my school, I experimented with productive tools that inevitably resulted in the production of a school-wide platform.\n\nFollowing my internship at [[camp social|Camp Social]] and work at [[hack club|Hack Club]], I felt comfortable designing and producing large-scale platforms. In the platform, similar to Slack or Snapshot, you can view all communities on the left hand side. The default page is a club directory. Within each page, there are customized repository views based on the club's themes and objectives. Individual organizations/clubs look like this:\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117175415.png]]\n\nCurrently, I am working to implement this platform with several other schools within my area and globally. I hope that this tool can make the communication of knowledge to teens like myself easier, for ambitious students ready to learn and teaching coordinators prepared to share what they're good at. \n\nAs of now, there are hundreds of users on the platform, **with ~100 daily active users**. Once the expansion launches, the platform will handle thousands of students internationally. \n\n### Previous Iterations\n\nThe very first iteration was meant for a single club. Ironically, it became a platform for a single-use case that we would never use. \n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117174807.png]]\n\nFollowing countless design iterations, it started to come together. The primary feedback for this iteration was customizing colours and making it less cluttered, especially for those with smaller screen sizes.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117174650.png]]\n\nBefore this idea began, there were several sources of inspiration that existed in different mechanisms. In each stage, I developed further insights from core users that would be genuinely interested.\n\n### Stage 1: Health Science Platform\n\nThe goal was to streamline education and centralize all the content needed. While the content was not intensive, there were four key advantages for teachers \u0026 students.\n\n1.  All content existed on a single platform, making case studies, terminology and weekly curriculum a constant. This often could replace the need for slideshows, or in other times make pre-existing slideshows more accessible during independent study.\n2.  The content was hosted on a single database, meaning adding content was incredibly simple—all information was dynamically updated, meaning instructors can add anything they need immediately.\n3.  This enabled diversified content that was readily accessible—a successful replacement to subsequent Google Classroom posts. Weekly content is easily organized and separated from the resources, making access to previous lessons simple and finding quick resources (ie case studies, exemplars \u0026 terminology) simple.\n4. It scaled. New features (ie semantic search, adding individual rooms, authentication and on-site posting) were implemented on the same database at extremely low maintenance.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117090616.png]]\n\n### Stage 2: Discussion\n\nI hosted conversations with several students who sought value in digital platforms. \n\nOverall, I came to three conclusions:\n1. Students that were new to clubs wanted a place for self-study, as they were unable to sufficiently particpiate nor fare well in competitions. Clubs are often very niche, making it difficult to apply general knowledge.\n2. For students that had a few skills did not find motivation to come to classes as knowledge was often repeated.\n3. Students that had a lot of experience wanted to get ahead, but did not have the facilities to learn more content than what was taught to them in previous years.\n\n### Stage 3: Sample Platform\n\nFor our school's coding club, I wanted to build a platform where students could access stream-based content and upload coding solutions. While it never went live, it provided insights into:\n1. Make sure knowledge is available within a few clicks—if it takes too long to find information, then the knowledge does not hold the same value\n2. Segment and classify all information. Make sure that information is shared methodically.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117180542.png]]\n\nWithin our school, platforms as such have changed the way that I understand the communication of information that — to me — often felt standard. I foresee this platform being used to streamline interactions within several schools \u0026 seeing new variations being deployed by young developers.\n\n---","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/ConnexSci":{"title":"ConnexSci","content":"\n\n!!","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Evolutionary-Game-Theory":{"title":"Evolutionary Game Theory","content":"\n### hie\nWrapping up my Internship at Camp Social.\n\n## The Thing\n\nasdf\n\n### Of Course\n\nwhat","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Financial-Literacy":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Food-Insecurity":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/posts/Hack-Club":{"title":"Imagineering With Hack Club","content":"\nThis summer, I got the opportunity to work with [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) to redesign their application flow.

This response seeks to explore both texts from a Feminist lens, comparing and contrasting how each work depicts the global struggle of women’s education. Hansberry wrote A Raisin in the Sun at a time when she was facing a similar strife herself, allowing her to craft the story to meticulously reflect reality. The authenticity of the play encourages the audience to empathize with each character’s story, one of which being Beneatha’s difficulties with her education. Satrapi, similarly, presents the experiences she has gone through by narrating Persepolis as a coming-of-age story - commencing and ending with her time in educational institutions. Satrapi’s structuring of the graphic novel accentuates the pivotal role that education plays in Marji’s life; an emphasis is brought to how it is a common thread running through a myriad of her adversities. Throughout both texts, the theme of women’s struggle with education is explored through the symbolic portrayal of main characters and bookending structure.\n\nLorraine Hansberry curates each character in her play to represent a different facet of the African-American’s experience in America during the 1950’s, an example being Beneatha who symbolizes adversity, progression, and rebellion. A Raisin in the Sun spotlights a family of vastly different members, each undergoing their own journey and bound together by their shared financial situation. Beneatha, a Black woman who falls under two minority groups, is in college studying medicine - an anomaly in American society at the time of this play. The adversities she faces as a result of her identity are foreshadowed through her name, Beneatha, which is an extension of the word beneath. Names being an integral component of one’s identity, the rebellious character possessing a name with its origins in a word negatively connoted, sets the foundation for all the struggles she will face as a result of who she is. Furthermore, Hansberry distinguishes Beneatha’s character as one reflecting progression in societal thoughts and systems. This paves the way for a deeper exploration of how systemic structures - such as the geographical and financial inaccessibility of schools - bar women from attaining a standard level education. Additionally, Beneatha is shown as a fearless and outspoken woman through repeatedly delivering her dialogue in a tone of heightened urgency. By bringing attention to how strong Beneatha is, the audience is posed with the question of why it is necessary for her to display such ferocity; the failures of society in educating women - Black women specifically - are brought to light.\n\nMarjane Sitrapi’s structuring of the book, last chapter, and panels, brings emphasis to the role of education in Marji’s life. The story centers around Marji’s life in Iran during the Iranian Revolution, and how the violent and extremist climate impacted her childhood growing up. Seen in the first chapter, and once again in the last, is the fact that the receiving of a holistic education is denied to Marji and contributes to the strife in her life. By bookending the story with this common theme, Sitrapi draws attention to the tumultuous nature of her school years, further deepening the devastation evoked within readers. The emotive structure of the book allows for readers to empathize with the gravity of the issue Sitrapi depicts. Furthermore, the last chapter focuses on how Marji’s struggle with a censored curriculum forces her to leave the country entirely. The structure of the chapter is set so that it transitions from a massive fight between Marji and her teacher at the beginning, to the scene of her departure from her home. The effectiveness of this structure lies in its cause and effect transitions, where the readers see not only the struggles Marji faces in regards to her schooling, but also the repercussions of them; the message of her adversities is thus conveyed well through the specific authorial choice of choosing the last chapter to reflect a full circle moment with her education. Moreover, the specific panels within this chapter show resentment through the facial expressions of the characters, allowing readers to grasp the frustrations felt by Marji and the true depth of her struggles. The furrowed eyebrows depict an aggression that is seen both literally and figuratively. Each character in the scene is emotionally charged, heightening the risk associated with Marji’s rebellion against the educational institutions. In portraying the vitality of the moment through intense confrontations, Sitrapi efficiently infuses the story with a theme of women’s struggle in education.\n\nA Raisin in the Sun and Persepolis, both, depict the struggles with education that women face through the authors’ intentional character depictions and text structures. A common link shared between Beneatha and Marji is how their ambition creates a situation where they rebel against their community’s expectations. Beneatha does not listen to her family who is trying to persuade her to give up, and Marji does not listen to her school which is trying to convince her of the fallacy of her beliefs. Both characters desire to challenge the systems that limit them, and do so by continuing to tune the voice of their society out. Though Hansberry and Sitrapi share similarities in their portrayal of these characters, the foundation of which these stories are built, contrast greatly. A Raisin in the Sun revolves around the life of a family collectively, within the span of a few months - allowing readers to zone in on the microscale repercussions of Beneatha’s struggles with education. Meanwhile, Persepolis spans over a time period of around two decades; readers are able to grasp the larger consequences of Marji’s turbulent schooling. Thus, it can be seen that both A Raisin in the Sun and Persepolis, while being texts of entirely separate forms, convey the universality and pertinence of exploring women’s education and lack-there-of.","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/tags/school/":{"title":"school","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/tags/work/":{"title":"works","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Atomic-Design":{"title":"Atomic Design","content":"\nAtomic desgin!!","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/To-all-the-fools-who-dream":{"title":"To all the fools who dream","content":"\ntest","lastmodified":"2022-11-18T02:55:52.603498499Z","tags":null}}
