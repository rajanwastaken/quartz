On the side, I'm working at [JEC Toronto](https://www.jectoronto.org/) (COO), [ChoiceDAO](https://www.choicedao.org/) (Core) and [Cobweb](https://www.cobweb.ca/) (Researcher). Previously, I worked at [Camp Social](https://www.camp.social/) as a Software Engineer Intern.  \n  \nIn my free time, I enjoy writing and spending time outdoors. I'm currently writing a novel, The Platonist, and playing competitive golf, tennis and long distance running.\n\nDo good work. Enjoy the journey.\n\n\u003e _People grow old only by deserting their ideals. Worry, doubt, self-distrust and fear; these are the long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit back to dust.  Whatever the years, there is in every being the love of wonder, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetite for what next, and the joy in the game of life._","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:39:25.436461728Z","tags":null},"/notes/school/english/The-Rachel-Divide":{"title":"The Rachel Divide","content":"\n1.

Despite the suggestion by Karl Lindner that “race prejudice simply doesn't enter into” Clybourne Park’s offer to buy back the Youngers’ home, he hints at the very real dangers that accompany the family’s decision to relocate to a white neighbourhood.\n\n\n\n\n## Raisin in the Sun Quotes\n\nPage 32: man needs woman to back him\nPage 33: eat your eggs\nPage 39: plant mentioned\nPage 44: rat trap\nPage 49: what other qualities in a man\nPage 53: elaboration of plant\nPage 59: female doctor\nPage 62: questioning/ridiculing insecurities\nPage 63: for a woman it should be enough\nPage 70: discrediting female doctor\nPage 80: made fun of for cultural wear\nPage 88: deprecative conversation between walter and ruth\nPage 95: head of the family\nPage 115: girl let the man talk\nPage 121: plant expresses her\nPage 129: daughters school money\nPage 133: i wanted to cure\nPage 143: i’m a man, woman should wear pearls\nPage 150: marry a man with loot\n\nHow is the text structured?\nIs the story told in chronological order?\nWhat type of narration is used?\nWhose point of view do we get to see?\nIs the narrator reliable?\n\nDo you think the Youngers are successful by the end of the play? \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:39:25.436461728Z","tags":null},"/tags/school/":{"title":"school","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:39:25.436461728Z","tags":null}}
