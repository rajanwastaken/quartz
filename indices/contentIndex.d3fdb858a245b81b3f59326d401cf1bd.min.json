State the title of the film and the year it was released.  Then briefly describe what the film is about and the position that it advocates. \n\nTell Me Who I am was a documentary released in 2019, detailing the lives of two twins following a major motorcycle accident which caused one twin to lose their memory to its entirety. \n\n 2.  Describe the progression of the film: how it begins, what stages it passes through, and how it concludes.\n\nAct I\n- Begins with distressful music that sets the scene of the original accident\n- Use for first-person view and close ups to immerse the viewer into the experience, to identify the shock that was associated with this event\n- He only remember ed his brother, not his mother or anyone else. He began to forget his own life — the use of music accentuated the shock of the experience\n- His brother was the only person he could trust, and Alex felt like he was alone in the world. Marcus helped him with everything in recreating the memories\n- As Alex wanted to explore his identity in more depth, he began to get more and more curious of his past, questioning things about their family and experience together\n- Alex was normalized to the idea of having distant parents and difficult living conditions — nothing to compare it to. \n- Marcus's reaction to the death of their parents greatly differed from Alex, raising questions as to the characters and relationships made with the twins\n- Alex realized that the one person that he could trust was lying to him, creating an emotional barrier with his only contact with reality.\n\nAct II\n- Alex is curious of his experiences with the family\n- Viewers are posed with the question of trust — if you only have one person to trust in your life, what would happen if they broke this trust?\n- Discovery of their past of sexual abuse from their mother and the image with the top cut off\n- Marcus began to lie for his own sanity, he could not reveal the truth as it would hurt him to the core\n- Difficult for Marcus to stop lying as the false reality has gone on for too long\n- Lying to Alex caused emotional damage, regardless of the fact that the truth would have scarred him as he was re-introduced to the new world\n- It was revealed that the mother sexually abused her sons throughout their childhood, Marcus chose to hide this for the sake of Alex's sanity\n- Marcus did not discuss his past for 20 years\n\nAct III\n- Older Marcus and Alex reconvene and have the discussion they wished they had at a young age\n- Use of visuals and music in conjunction with flashbacks build suspense\n- Marcus claims that he was lying for himself — he was trying to share the life he wish he had\n- Now that the lie has been removed, the bed from the first Act is shined upon with music to convey relief\n\n\n3. List six facts described in the film that impressed you and explain how each fact relates to the film’s premise or theme. \n\n\t1. Alex was able to maintain his proficiency in english and daily habits, but not remember people — raised questions of inquiry into what happened following the accident\n\t2. The two boys were sexually abused at a young age, and this trauma was unclear for both of them. This uncertainty of these situations increased the suspense and worry in the viewers, raising questions as to the harsh realities of their childhood\n\t3. A lot of the abuse towards the children remained hidden due to their dyslexia, making it difficult for them to communicate verbally and through writing. The twins, as a result, used their personal encounters to develop a connection\n\t4. The twins' step siblings was rarely mentioned in the documentary, which makes the audience question whether they were sexually abused as well.\n\t5. It was only until after their mother died that Alex discovered the sexual abuse as a child, highlighting the restrictive nature of their interactions.\n\t6. Until the age of 14, both boys were involved in a series of sexual abuse cases with her mother's friends and those around her. The tragedy, which lasted for the majority of their childhood, was difficult to convey and thus he kept it to himself. Alex's unabashed curiosity eventually destroys his understanding of his past and trust of Alex.\n\n4.   How did the filmmakers try to convince you of the position that the film supports? Look for appeals to logic, emotion, and prejudice. \n\nThe film is not solely about the accident; it is a reflection on the long-lasting repercussions of sexual assault, the complex issue of \"good\" lies, and the moral conundrum that results from suppressing distressing truth. The use of key symbols like the bed and the personalized experience from editing helps the audience understand the trauma through an appeal to emotion. \n\n5. Did any of the reasoning given in support of the position advocated by the film seem to be weak or misleading?  If so, describe the concept put forward in the film and why you thought the reasoning was flawed.\n\nThe audience is made to fill in the blanks of many parts of the film. It often goes between the age of 18 to 30 to 60, which forces the viewer to make connections to what happens in this gap. \n\n6.  Describe any cinematic techniques used in presenting particular scenes, images, or sounds that were designed to appeal to the viewer’s emotions and to encourage the viewer to agree with the position advocated by the film, without reliance upon fact or logical argument.\n\nRe-Enactment: key household items and parts of their childhood were recreated to share an insightful take on their past\n\nFlashback: shared moments from their past are displayed again, with archival footage or recreations of childhood moments\n\nLighting: the entirety of the film, until the very last scene, maintains low-key lighting to convey suspense and darkness\n\nMusic: the audio and music are always suspenseful, keeping viewers anticipated and on their toes\n\n7.   If the filmmakers asked how this film could be improved, what would you tell them?  Describe the changes you would suggest in detail.\n\nProvide more context into key parts of their childhood; there is a lot of repetition between Alex and Marcus who sometimes have the same take on a certain issue or a piece of their past. \n\nAnalyze the perspectives of those they interacted with in their lives. Exploring the lives of their step sisters or close friends may provide more insight into how his memory loss was perceived.\n\n8. Did the film change your mind about any aspect of the subject that it presents? What information, argument or persuasive technique caused you to change your mind?\n\nThe documentary, although not trying to prove a point, helped gain more insight into the varying perspectives. Upon my first interaction with Marcus's choices, I was shocked to see that he hid the truth for more than a decade. However, as the film progressed, cinematic devices helped understand the risk that Marcus took and to empathize with his situation — he was lying for his own sanity to develop the childhood he wish he had.\n\n9. Can you make any connections to a Global Issue? How so? Which literary work studied in the course can you connect this documentary to? \n\nThe primary issue presented in the documentary is the role of childhood trauma in the progression of one's life. This connects to Persepolis, who faced an authoritarian government in the face of harsh violence towards women. Similarly, in a Rachel Divide, Rachel claims that her childhood abuse was a precursor for the choice of her identity.","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/notes/school/english/The-Rachel-Divide-Viewing-Guide":{"title":"Rachel Divide Vieweing Guide","content":"\n\n### Questions\n\n1. State the title of the film and the year it was released.  Then briefly describe what the film is about and the position that it advocates. \n\nThe Rachel Divide was filmed and published in 2018, taking on the challenge of analyzing Rachel Dolezal's conflicting identity — and more importantly, her expression of this identity. The documentary takes into consideration her family's perspectives and that of the NCAAP, questioning whether her consideration as a black woman was justified. \n\n 2.  Describe the progression of the film: how it begins, what stages it passes through, and how it concludes.\n\nThe film begins with the context under which Rachel's life and identity was exposed, where her and her son were put in the face of danger. Rachel was exposed during the increasing amount of police brutality that existed in her community — she mentioned how her identity was shaped by her *oppressive childhood.*\n\nIn news scenes, there is a stronger understanding of the social in-acceptance of her choice. With high media attention, she is faced by social criticism by those in the Black community. During the Facebook Live interview, she is challenged by digital influencers that take offense to her *transracial* identity. She is also challenged by talk shows and news reports, notably The Today Show. On Instagram, her posts often get hate comments — some of which challenge her identity and others her desire for media attention.\n\nTo gain a stronger understanding of the context behind her choice, conversations with her son and family are introduced. Her son is deeply entangled in the issue and feels threatened by the beliefs of her mother. Her parents of birth were disapproving from her switch and found shame in her newfound identity. \n\nThe film ends with her going to the DMV and changing her name from Rachel to Nkechi Amare, and her publicly embracing a false identity.\n\n3. List six facts described in the film that impressed you and explain how each fact relates to the film’s premise or theme. \n\n\t1. Rachel felt a strong connection to Black heritage and people of the African-American community.\n\t2. As of 2018, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by _police_ during their lifetime\n\t3. She grew up in an abusive household. Her parents, Larry and Ruthann, are described as religious extremists who faced severe consequences.\n\t4. She is facing financial struggles and is, by extension, being discredited by African-Americans that are facing the same issues as a result of prejudice.\n\t5. Very limited influence from Dolezal's parents, Franklin's dad and the father of her most recent child — these voices may provide insight into the familial acceptance of her choice\n\t6. Her son was deeply affected by the high amount of media attention, now being turned into a documentary. Dolezal's inability to assess the consequences beyond her own life brought attention to the credibility of her opinions.\n\n4.   How did the filmmakers try to convince you of the position that the film supports? Look for appeals to logic, emotion, and prejudice. \n\nLarge emphasis on news articles and varying types of media that went against her point. For all the arguments she brought up, which were limited to the editor's perspective, she was perceived to be crazy and delusional. Directly juxtaposed credible sources and personal anecdotes to her opinion. During points against her, there is usually triumphant music and a quick pace, while her arguments face somber music and very slow imagery. \n\nMentions of her parents and influencers appeal to prejudice in an attempt to share an impartial take on the consequences of her switch. Mentions of news reports and direct features aim for an appeal to logic by providing credible sources of analysis. Mentions of her son provide an appeal to emotion, through an analysis of how this is affecting the next generation of her family.\n\n5. Did any of the reasoning given in support of the position advocated by the film seem to be weak or misleading?  If so, describe the concept put forward in the film and why you thought the reasoning was flawed.\n\nIn the way that the film was edited, her arguments were often discredited by conveying a constant stream of lies and deceitful thinking on her end. It reached the point where the audience — and the people around her — were unable to trust her anymore. There were a few strong points, however these were quickly contrasted by credible sources or verifiable members of her family. This also applies to a few claims that she made, notable that \"race is a social construct\".\n\n6.  Describe any cinematic techniques used in presenting particular scenes, images, or sounds that were designed to appeal to the viewer’s emotions and to encourage the viewer to agree with the position advocated by the film, without reliance upon fact or logical argument.\n\nRe-Enactment: Visual scenes from her childhood that were recreated for dramatic effects in flashbacks\n\nMontage: during scenes of media attention, the most influential points made were compiled together\n\nEye-Level: documentary created the feeling of speaking directly to Dolezal\n\nLighting: during scenes of rebuttal, there is often high-key lighting to emphasize credibility and reliability. During the somber moments of her discussion, she faced low-key lighting\n\n7.   If the filmmakers asked how this film could be improved, what would you tell them?  Describe the changes you would suggest in detail.\n\nEmphasize more on the personal experiences of those that were affected by her switch. How exactly did this affect the African-American community; what was done in compromise by Dolezal, if anything?\n\nIn discussion of her son, take into consideration his future — does publishing this documentary with more media attention change the course of his future? How will this affect his life?\n\n8. Did the film change your mind about any aspect of the subject that it presents? What information, argument or persuasive technique caused you to change your mind?\n\nAlthough this was a new topic for me, my first interpretation was ridiculing/questioning the viability of this idea. As the film progressed, my opinion did not change much. Instead of sympathizing with Rachel, I took into consideration the direct consequences of her actions, specifically with her son. The emphasis of external views persuaded me to side with the media, and continue my perspective of this being an improper choice.\n\n9. Can you make any connections to a Global Issue? How so? Which literary work studied in the course can you connect this documentary to? \n\nThis strongly resonates with the social stratification involved with racial identity. Connections can be made to Persepolis, where she tries to fit in with Western society, as well as A Raisin in the Sun where racial barriers are precursors for discrimination\n\n---\n\n\n### Post-film Analysis\n\n### Sympathy\n- Private Life (eye-level)\n\t- Family\n\t- Household\n\t- Friends\n- Crying/Frustration\n\t- Frustration within family\n\t- Anecdotes from children; how it's ruining family\n- Emotional/Somber Music\n- Social Media --\u003e negativity\n- Her side of the story/impact on the community\n\n### Opposition\n- Interviews with Black women\n- Facebook/Social Media Interviews \u0026 Opinions\n- News Channels (Clips --\u003e Ethos)\n- Interviews with her Son and frustrations\n- Interviews with biological family ","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/notes/school/tok/TOK-Journal":{"title":"","content":"This week, in our TOK class, we watched a documentary called *The Rachel Divide*, featuring a woman who identified as Black although she was born to two white parents. \n\nHow does the way that we organize or classify knowledge affect what we know?\n\n- In our English class, we watched a documentary called **The Rachel Divide**, a spin off of the phrase *racial divide* — it featured a woman who identified herself as Black, although she was born with two white parents.

How was Edison’s approach to science and innovation different to Tesla’s?\n\nApproaches to science, for Eddison and Tesla, became congruent with approaches to social systems. Tesla, who was \"[insistent] on solitude\" was living life on innovation. Pure ideas became his adrenaline, so he thrived off of independent reflection. Edison, on the other hand, realized that \"genius loves company\" — in the presence of other thinkers, then ideas can become tangible realities without concern for limits. Tesla believed that innovation required carefully cultivated ideation, something inherent to the creator and only possible to carry through by the only person that can truly understand: oneself. While isolation is considered to be ineffective, Tesla's tech was unequivocally superior. The most suitable approach that remains to this day, community-focused creation, was Edison's key to rapid success and allowed him to approach and tackle problems that lead to the most efficient and effective results. Tesla had groundbreaking tech, Edison had a team that scaled ideas beyond the time's imagination.\n\n\n2. What was the result of this - for both men?\n\nEdison used his community of builders to design the best possible product; Tesla experimented in great detail until he perfected his tech. In the creation of the lightbulb, a community-first effort led to the efficient discovery of a pear-shaped bulb, which conserved the most energy and produced a lasting glow — something that Edison could not figure out himself. While this was the most effective and quickest method, Edison's fame may be put to question due to the high influence of his team. Tesla's fame lies in deeply rooted experimentation and knowledge, during his work to discover the AC motor and transmission technology. Technologically, both men found fame and success in their innovations, through leadership and solitude.\n\n\u003e \"Learning happens int he minds and souls, not in the databases of multiple-choice tests\" - Ken Robinson\n\n- The arts are victims of this mentality, proposing the aesthetic experience when senses are operating at their peak\n- Getting children through education by anaesthetizing them\n- How do we measure the potential of human beings?\n- \tEconomic wealth\n- \tAbility to apply knowledge under stress\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/pages/Untitled.md":{"title":"","content":"help\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/pages/contents":{"title":"conents","content":"\nhelp","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/":{"title":"Posts","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.024711566Z","tags":null},"/posts/Arterial":{"title":"Arterial","content":"\n## Camp Social\n\n### hie\nWrapping up my Internship at Camp Social.\n\n## The Thing\n\nasdf\n\n### Of Course\n\nwhat","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/Blind-Spot":{"title":"Blind Spot","content":"\nBlind Spot\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/Bloom-Network":{"title":"Bloom Network","content":"\nActive health care.","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/ChoiceDAO":{"title":"Raising $20K for Reproductive Access","content":"\nThis page is under construction!\n\nTL;DR: I worked with ChoiceDAO and lead the fundraising and distribution of $20,000USD+ for organizations in this public domain.","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/ConnexSci":{"title":"Winning Canada's Largest Hackathon","content":"\nIn September 2022, our team of high school students were a finalist at Hack the North, the largest Canadian university hackathon. We built **ConnexSci**, our solution to materializing research in the private domain.\n\nThere are fundamental barriers in the conventional research and scientific funding model that need to be addressed to accelerate the pace of discovery and commercializing research.\n\n1.  Large funding bodies have made the process of getting funding bureaucratic over time and slow, and researchers are forced to spend the majority of their time applying for funding and design their experiment around a **limited, fixed** set of funds. This makes the process of funding more complex and it make sit harder for new and promising research to gain traction.\n2.  The translation stage from early research to commercial pipelines (startups, biopharma) has become more complex, and terms + agreements around transfer strongly incentivize close-guarding IP from scientists. Terms are unfavourable to cause investors to lose interest in financing translation efforts.\n3.  Venture Capitals and other LPs have little incentive and limited pool of possible companies and initiatives to finance because the change of success is hard to evaluate at such an early stage + not all technologies/research are able to return high returns. Big Pharma’s direct incentive to develop and acquire drugs with the largest possibilie market while miniziming R\u0026D costs but this can skew research to areas that are established without assessing market need.\n\nOur goal was to leverage Deep Learning and Network Insights to support new financial mechanisms for funding research that is important but incompatible in the status-quo funding space. The primary metrics are speed, ROI, and producitivity of the funds that are being used in said research.\n\n## The Platform\n\nWe were deeply inspired by tools like [Elicit](https://elicit.org), that summarize large volumes of research into readable information. We also found interest in [[posts/thoughtful interfaces|interfaces]]  like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), that can organize networks of knowledge into graphs.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221203225027.png]]\n*Hackathon iteration of ConnexSci*\n\nAlthough this was only a hackathon project, we were quickly introduced to the problem of scale. We had to manage hundreds of thousands of research papers and build deep connections between them to repurpose existing knowledge. We approached this using distributed nodes:\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221203230252.png]]\n\nWe also chose to use use GraphML and NLP to identify high-impact research projects and allocate the necessary capital for producing effective therapies while reducing the financial and regulatory bottlenecks to translate early-stage drug discovery research into commercial products.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221203224533.png]]\n*University of Waterloo*\n\nThe knowledge graph connects three types of nodes: `Paper`, `Mesh` and `Category`. Their connections were illustrated in the following JSON:\n\n```json\n{ \"nodes\" : [{\n   \"FIELD1\": 1,\n   \"id\": \"1\", // only point of connection is the id\n   \"name\": \"On rank correlation in information retrieval evaluation\",\n   \"url\": \"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1273221.1273223\",\n   \"abstract\": \"Some methods for rank correlation in evaluation are examined and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed.

In particular, attention should be paid to the null hypothesis. Other measures for rank correlation are described. If one test statistic suggests to reject a hypothesis, other test statistics should be used to support or to revise the decision. The paper then focuses on rank correlation between webpage lists ordered by PageRank for applying the general reflections on these test statistics.

It is based on the assumption that individuals will tend to adopt strategies that are successful in achieving their goals, and that these strategies will evolve over time as individuals compete with each other for resources. This process can lead to the emergence of complex behavior, such as cooperation and coordination, as well as the formation of social structures and hierarchies.\n\nThis concept can be used to understand how different organs within the human body may evolve in response to the strategies of other organs. The heart and lungs may be seen as using an evolutionarily stable strategy in order to maintain a consistent supply of oxygen to the body's cells. This strategy may be invaded by other organs, such as the liver or kidneys, if they are not functioning properly.\n\n# Organ Networks\n\nThe heart and lungs may be seen as using an evolutionarily stable strategy in order to maintain a consistent supply of oxygen to the body's cells. This strategy may be invaded by other organs, such as the liver or kidneys, if they are not functioning properly.\n\nTo understand how this might work, consider a simple game in which the heart and lungs are competing with the liver and kidneys for a limited supply of resources. The heart and lungs use a strategy of pumping oxygen-rich blood throughout the body, while the liver and kidneys use a strategy of filtering impurities from the blood. In this game, the heart and lungs are likely to have a higher fitness because their strategy is necessary for the survival of the body's cells.\n\nHere is a simple example of a game.\n\n| | Heart and Lungs | Liver and Kindey |\n| --- | --- | ---|\n| Heart and Lungs | -1, -1 | -10, 10 |\n| Livery and Kidney | 10, -10 | -5, 5 |\n\nIn evolutionary game theory, the fitness of a strategy is typically quantified using the replicator equation, which is given by:\n\n$$\\dot{x_i} = x_i(\\pi_i - \\bar{\\pi})$$\n\nIn this equation, $x_i$ represents the relative frequency of strategy $i$ in the population, $\\pi_i$ is the average payoff for strategy $i$, and $\\bar{\\pi}$ is the average payoff for the population as a whole.\n\nAnother key tool used in evolutionary game theory is replicator dynamics, which is a set of equations that describe how the frequencies of different strategies in a population will change over time. Here is an example of the replicator dynamics equations:\n\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{x} \\odot (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\bar{\\mathbf{A}}\\mathbf{x}) $$\n\nThis can be extended by techniques like the Nash equilibrium, which can be defined mathematically using the following equation:\n\n$$ \\text{Nash Equilibrium: } \\mathbf{x}^* \\text{ such that } \\forall i, \\mathbf{x_i}^* \\in \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf{x_i}} (\\mathbf{A}_{i,\\bullet}\\mathbf{x}^*) $$\n\nIn this game, the numbers in each cell represent the payoffs for each pair of strategies. For example, in the top left cell, the numbers -1 and -1 represent the payoffs for the heart and lungs when both players use the same strategy.\n\nIn this particular game, the heart and lungs have a higher fitness because their strategy is necessary for the survival of the body's cells. However, if the liver and kidneys are not functioning properly, then their strategy may become more successful. This could lead to a shift in the population of organs, with more individuals adopting the strategy of the liver and kidneys. Over time, this could lead to a change in the overall strategy of the body, with a greater emphasis on filtering impurities from the blood.\n\n# Depth\n\nExploring Evolutionary Game Theory in depth uses two core methods.\n\n### Price Method\n\nThe Price equation, which describes how the genetic variation within a population will change over time. Here is an example of the Price equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\mathbf{Cov}(\\mathbf{f}, \\mathbf{w}) $$\n\nIn these equations, $V$ represents the total genetic variation in the population, and $\\mathbf{f}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ are vectors representing the fitnesses and frequencies of different genetic variants. The operator $\\mathbf{Cov}$ represents the covariance between the two vectors.\n\nThe Price equation can be used to understand how the genetic variation within a population of organs will change over time in response to natural selection. It is an important tool for studying the evolution of organ systems and their interconnectedness.\n\n### Monte Carlo Method\n\nIn these equations, $\\mathbf{x}_n$ represents the current state of the system, and $\\mathbf{r}_n$ is a random vector that is used to update the state of the system. The Monte Carlo method works by repeatedly updating the state of the system using random vectors and averaging the results to approximate the solution to the problem.\n\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{x}_n + \\mathbf{r}_n $$\n\nThe Monte Carlo method can be used to study the evolution of organ systems in evolutionary game theory. For example, it can be used to simulate the interactions between different organs and their strategies over time, and to approximate the resulting evolution of the organ system. This can provide insight into the complex dynamics of organ evolution and their interconnectedness.\n\n# Building Fleet\n\nFleet is an evolutionary game theory model that examines the interconnectedness of organ systems. \n\n### Individual Games\n\nGames are played for a fixed number of rounds, and each organ has a strategy of either cooperating or defecting.\n\nAt each round of the game, the payoffs for each organ are computed based on their strategies. These payoffs are determined by a pre-defined payoff matrix that assigns a payoff to each combination of strategies. For example, if the brain cooperates and the heart defects, the payoff for the brain is 0 and the payoff for the heart is 5.\n\nThe code also includes a mutation mechanism, which randomly changes the strategies of the organs with a certain probability (the mutation rate). This simulates the process of evolution, where random mutations can lead to changes in the strategies of the organs over time.\n\nAt the end of each round, the payoffs for each organ are printed to the console. This allows the user to see how the payoffs change over time as the strategies of the organs evolve.\n\nGames that evalute interactions between the Heart, Lungs and Kidney can be determined with this:\n\n```cpp\n...\nvoid playRound(unordered_map\u003cstring, char\u003e\u0026 strategies) {\n  double random = (double)rand() / RAND_MAX;\n  if (random \u003c MUTATION_RATE) {\n    strategies[\"heart\"] = (strategies[\"heart\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE) ? STRATEGY_DEFECT : STRATEGY_COOPERATE;\n  }\n  // continue this for all strategies\n\t...\n  int payoff_heart, payoff_lungs, payoff_kidney;\n  if (strategies[\"heart\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE \u0026\u0026 strategies[\"lungs\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE \u0026\u0026 strategies[\"kidney\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE) {\n  ...\n  } else if (strategies[\"heart\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE \u0026\u0026 strategies[\"lungs\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE \u0026\u0026 strategies[\"kidney\"] == STRATEGY_DEFECT) {\n    // Heart and lungs cooperate, kidney defects\n    ...\n  } \n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, games with the Brain and Heart may be determined with this:\n\n```cpp\n...\nvoid playRound(unordered_map\u003cstring, char\u003e\u0026 strategies) {\n  double random = (double)rand() / RAND_MAX;\n  if (random \u003c MUTATION_RATE) {\n    strategies[\"brain\"] = (strategies[\"brain\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE) ? STRATEGY_DEFECT : STRATEGY_COOPERATE;\n  }\n  ...\n\n  random = (double)rand() / RAND_MAX;\n...\n  if (random \u003c MUTATION_RATE) {\n    strategies[\"heart\"] = (strategies[\"heart\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE) ? STRATEGY_DEFECT : STRATEGY_COOPERATE;\n  }\n  \n  int payoff_brain, payoff_heart;\n  if (strategies[\"brain\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE \u0026\u0026 strategies[\"heart\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE) {\n    payoff_brain = 3;\n    payoff_heart = 3;\n  } else if (strategies[\"brain\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE \u0026\u0026 strategies[\"heart\"] == STRATEGY_DEFECT) {\n    payoff_brain = 0;\n    payoff_heart = 5;\n  } else if (strategies[\"brain\"] == STRATEGY_DEFECT \u0026\u0026 strategies[\"heart\"] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAt each round of the game, the payoffs for each organ are computed based on their strategies. These payoffs are determined by a pre-defined payoff matrix that assigns a payoff to each combination of strategies. For example, if the brain cooperates and the heart defects, the payoff for the brain is 0 and the payoff for the heart is 5.\n\nThe code also includes a mutation mechanism, which randomly changes the strategies of the organs with a certain probability (the mutation rate). This simulates the process of evolution, where random mutations can lead to changes in the strategies of the organs over time.\n\n### Evaluating Effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness directly analyzes the theorietically determined data.\n\n```cpp\nvoid compareResults(String strategies, double actual_heart, double actual_lungs, double actual_kidney) {\n  double simulated_heart = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i \u003c strategies.length(); i++) {\n    if (strategies[i] == STRATEGY_COOPERATE) {\n    ...\n    } else if (strategies[i] == STRATEGY_DEFECT) {\n    ...\n    }\n  }\n  simulated_heart /= strategies.length();\n  double mse_heart = pow(simulated_heart - actual_heart, 2);\n  Serial.print(mse_heart);\n  // continue for lung, brain or other organs\n}\n```\n\nThe code defines several assumptions and parameters for the simulation, such as the population size, the number of generations, and the mutation rate.\n\nThe code then generates theoretical data based on these assumptions and parameters, using a function called `generateTheoreticalFitness()`. This function produces a vector of theoretical fitness values for each generation of the simulation.\n\nNext, the code runs the actual simulation by initializing a population of organisms and calling the `runSimulation()` function. This function simulates the evolution of the population over multiple generations, and returns a vector of actual fitness values for each generation.\n\nAfter the simulation is complete, the code compares the theoretical and actual data by calculating the difference between the fitness values in each generation. This allows the user to see how closely the simulated data matches the theoretical predictions. `compareResults()` compares the simulated payoffs for each organ with the actual payoffs. This is done by computing the mean squared error for each organ, which is a measure of the difference between the simulated and actual payoffs. The function then displays the mean squared error.\n\n# Resolution\n\nThe connection between organs is an important topic in evolutionary game theory. This is because organs are interdependent on each other, and the strategies they use can have a profound impact on their fitness and the overall functioning of the body.\n\nOne of the key ideas in evolutionary game theory is the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), which is a strategy that cannot be invaded by any other strategy. This means that if a population of players is using an ESS, then any individual who tries to use a different strategy will be at a disadvantage and will eventually be forced to switch back to the ESS. This can lead to the emergence of stable social structures and behaviors within a population.\n\nThis can provide insight into the complex relationships between different organs within the body, and may help to identify potential problems or areas for improvement. Existing research has explored intercellular interactions.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221203215442.png]]\n\nIn order to study the evolution of strategies, evolutionary game theory makes use of tools from population dynamics and evolutionary biology, such as replicator dynamics and fitness landscapes. These tools allow us to track the evolution of strategies over time and understand how they interact with each other.\n\nFor example, in the simulation discussed earlier, the heart and the lungs had to make a decision about whether to cooperate or defect. If both organs chose to cooperate, they both received a payoff of 3. However, if one organ chose to cooperate and the other chose to defect, the organ that cooperated received a payoff of 0, while the organ that defected received a payoff of 5. This example shows how the strategies of organs can affect their payoffs and fitness. It also demonstrates the complex interconnectedness of organs, where the actions of one organ can have a significant impact on the payoffs of other organs.\n\nThe connection between organs is an important topic in evolutionary game theory, and has many implications for the study of organ evolution and the functioning of the body as a whole. By understanding the dynamics of organ evolution and their interconnectedness, we can gain valuable insights into how the body works and how it may evolve over time.\n\n---","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/Financial-Literacy":{"title":"Creating Opportunities at JEC Toronto","content":"\n\n!!","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/Food-Insecurity":{"title":"Provincial Food Insecurity","content":"\nThis page is under construction. In the meantime, read this short summary of the work I completed locally and globally:\n\n\n\nWe were challenged to find one political issue in our community and create an actionable solution. As a volunteer at my local food bank, I explored our city’s rapidly rising rates of food insecurity, regardless of our urban and democratic status. I discovered that most funding was towards food banks, instead of the foundational issue: the price of food. Here, I took initiative to address the issue locally, nationally and globally. Locally, I worked directly with food banks across the city to implement cost-saving strategies and distribute a digital petition — one that reached 200+ signatures. I booked meetings with our local Federal Member of Parliament and Member of Provincial Parliament; several consultations later, I was personally directed to the Ontario Ministry of Health, where I presented the petition and shared my pitch for new means of food distribution. I continued conversations that led to many others in the area, most notably PROOF Canada, an interdisciplinary research program addressing household food insecurity, to lobby for change.\n\nTo this end, I extended my learning to a digital internship in Bauchi, Nigeria, where I hosted virtual community workshops in their city and generated a report for my school and community leaders. Here, I applied my knowledge of internal sovereignty and hybrid regimes in discussion with local members of government. Through these connections, I worked directly with the Nagari Medical Clinic \u0026 Maternity Ward that helped draw parallels between systems of capitalism around the world. Here, I developed my repertoire of theory and political practice in search of a more universal answer to problems often neglected in the world—problems like sustainable development.","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.020711582Z","tags":null},"/posts/Hack-Club":{"title":"Imagineering With Hack Club","content":"\nThis summer, I got the opportunity to work with [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) to redesign their application flow. This would handle all new applications for students to start a Hack Club at their own schools, connecting students with delegates from around the world.\n\nThis project was featured in **Github's Newsletter, Hack Club's VIP Newsletter and other media** during the launch, culminating to **1M+ interactions** with the platform. The platform manages **6000+ users actively in multiple languages**.\n\nUsing full-stack principles, my intention in this platform was storytelling. People should understand what Hack Club is, their core values and why applying was the right choice. A core part of developing this experience was interactivity and a linear flow — instead of individual pages, one develops a stronger understanding of Hack Club as they progress.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117203113.png]]\nHere, students can invite co-leaders to fill out the application with them; these co-leaders get a separate view of the platform. On this page, there is a brief outline of what needs to be done and how long the process will take. \n\n![[images/Screenshot 2022-11-15 at 9.07.12 PM.png]]\nAbove is a sample of an individual page, where student leaders are asked to fill out information about themselves and details of the club.

Applications are screened by the Club Operations Team. Each large step (starting the application, inviting coleads, submitting, acceptance, etc...) are also coordinated with emails for confirmation of progression.\n\n### Previous Design\n\nWith the previous design, there were a few core details that must be fixed\n\n1. The application should be linear. It should be evident how to begin and how to finish the application.\n2. Interactions with the site are complimented with alerts, making it difficult to experiment and test things out\n3. It was unclear what next steps were when applying and how to interact with specific parts of the platform\n4. Add multi-lingual support! A significant amount of applicants apply to Hack Club Brasil, requiring Portuges.\n5. Questions should be more inclusive, aligning with Hack Club's values\n6. SEO should be fixed — starting a coding club should be congruent with starting a Hack Club\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117211500.png]]\n\nThis summer, I hope that I helped make starting a Hack Club easier for students around the world.

While aligning the value received by community leaders and participants has always been important, modern communities can go further to establish a tighter connection between the value to members and the overall organization’s worth.\n\nWhat we really desire is a place where we feel the sense of belonging that we felt in our childhoods. A place that was structured yet full of freedom and excitement. It was a place where we created memories and relationships that lasted a lifetime; where we could engage with others without feeling that stakes were high. \n\n_**Remember summer camp?**_\n\nWhen I first met [Zvi Band](https://zvi.band), I was introduced to Camp Social — when introduced to the loneliness crisis that tools like Discord or Telegram might enable, it raised questions as to how we can restore humanity in digital connections. To me, Camp Social was the platform that enabled social contribution and recognized individuals for doing so. \n\nThis summer, I interned as a Software Engineer with the intention to restore humanity on the internet — it was so much more. Through these five months, I **wrote \u0026 pushed 3245 lines of code, built microservices with Ruby on Rails, Solidity and Typescript and listened to 100+ hours of music** along the way. \n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117235345.png]]\n\n### There were two fundamnetal parts of the application that I worked on:\n\n**The infrastructure to allow community members to meet and connect with each other through shared social activities, online or offline.**\n- Employing [[thoughts/Atomic Design]] helped organize communities, broken down into individual events, each of which broken into user video conferences.\n- We wanted to recreate the feeling of being in camp; this theme was critical to isolating and interacting with features of the platform. \n- We wanted to focus on making individuals feel valued and rewarded for their contributions. A common case study we drew from was [Project Aristotle](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/after-years-of-research-google-discovered-secret-weapon-to-building-a-great-team-its-a-lesson-in-emotional-intelligence.html), as well as the team-building I did at [[posts/hack club|Hack Club]].\n- One can host small group sessions or facilitations of larger groups which follows our workflow: *members can post any kind of activity they want to host, others can RSVP, and attendance is tracked and rewarded.*\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117235533.png]]\n\n**A recognition and incentive mechanism to reward members to host and participate in those shared activities.**\n- With a primary market in DAOs, incentivization was primarily on-chain. I wrote/modified Smart Contracts, and built microservices to wrap \u0026 interact with them.\n- Wrote an API to connect with incentivization mechanisms and reward activity on the platform\n- By tokenizing communities we would (1) reward bottoms-up social contribution (2) enable proof of participation mechanisms (3) identify individuals interested in socials for future engagement\n- In reference to [Vitalik's interpretations of souldbound governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html): *there are very bad things that can easily happen to governance mechanisms if governance power is easily transferable*. Hence, Camp Social aims to implement non-transferability in practice.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117235838.png]]\n\nWhat we seek in communities is a sense of belonging to a greater whole. Unfortunately, the current experience in digital communities leaves a lot to be improved. The ability to form individual connections with other members is vital to the strength of the community. A noisy chat server does not help needed personal connections between community members - instead, it can feel like everyone’s shouting at each other across a crowded room. \n\nOverall, I was able to engineer features to a product that aims to restore humanity in the way we connect and interact on the internet. It challenged me to learn Ruby on Rails from scratch in one week, as well as take on a new endeavour in the field of tokenomics. The code that I shipped will help reward the ambitious and connect the those that want a break from the chaos we call the internet.\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.024711566Z","tags":null},"/posts/thoughtful-interfaces":{"title":"Designing Collective Community Interfaces","content":"\nAt my school, clubs develop teams to streamline workflows and produce content as quickly as possible. One of the most common positions was **web and tech**, providing students the opportunity to take technical challenges in designing websites and configuring AV equipment. While websites like these help provide a cohesive set of information for each club, it brings **brand new complications in the communication of new knowledge**.\n\nThis year, for my school, I decided to get rid of the need for separate websites that require high-maintenance and build a cohesive platform for all students. In conversation with several students, there were a few postulates:\n1. This should also act as a club directory. Students want to know what clubs are available and how to learn more about them. This includes a status, descriptions and team details.\n2. Only students with specific email addresses should be allowed to access the platform, as a security issue. It was also recommended to use email-link login to ensure only the user can access their platform.\n3. Club executives should be able to post and manage content as administrators. One could have member access, writing access or administrator access.\n4. Content should be divided **[[thoughts/Atomic Design|atomically]]**. Organizations are divided into repositories, each of which with notebooks consisting of indiviudal posts. \n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117094111.png|Home View]]\n\nThe primary issue with education is that it’s standardized—means for self-study are absolutely critical to turn weekly club lessons into meaningful interactions. Within my school, I experimented with productive tools that inevitably resulted in the production of a school-wide platform.\n\nFollowing my internship at [[camp-social|Camp Social]] and work at [[hack club|Hack Club]], I felt comfortable designing and producing large-scale platforms. In the platform, similar to Slack or Snapshot, you can view all communities on the left hand side. The default page is a club directory. Within each page, there are customized repository views based on the club's themes and objectives. Individual organizations/clubs look like this:\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117175415.png]]\n\nCurrently, I am working to implement this platform with several other schools within my area and globally. I hope that this tool can make the communication of knowledge to teens like myself easier, for ambitious students ready to learn and teaching coordinators prepared to share what they're good at. \n\nAs of now, there are hundreds of users on the platform, **with ~100 daily active users**. Once the expansion launches, the platform will handle thousands of students internationally. \n\n### Previous Iterations\n\nThe very first iteration was meant for a single club. Ironically, it became a platform for a single-use case that we would never use. \n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117174807.png]]\n\nFollowing countless design iterations, it started to come together. The primary feedback for this iteration was customizing colours and making it less cluttered, especially for those with smaller screen sizes.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117174650.png]]\n\nBefore this idea began, there were several sources of inspiration that existed in different mechanisms. In each stage, I developed further insights from core users that would be genuinely interested.\n\n### Stage 1: Health Science Platform\n\nThe goal was to streamline education and centralize all the content needed. While the content was not intensive, there were four key advantages for teachers \u0026 students.\n\n1.  All content existed on a single platform, making case studies, terminology and weekly curriculum a constant. This often could replace the need for slideshows, or in other times make pre-existing slideshows more accessible during independent study.\n2.  The content was hosted on a single database, meaning adding content was incredibly simple—all information was dynamically updated, meaning instructors can add anything they need immediately.\n3.  This enabled diversified content that was readily accessible—a successful replacement to subsequent Google Classroom posts. Weekly content is easily organized and separated from the resources, making access to previous lessons simple and finding quick resources (ie case studies, exemplars \u0026 terminology) simple.\n4.

New features (ie semantic search, adding individual rooms, authentication and on-site posting) were implemented on the same database at extremely low maintenance.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117090616.png]]\n\n### Stage 2: Discussion\n\nI hosted conversations with several students who sought value in digital platforms. \n\nOverall, I came to three conclusions:\n1. Students that were new to clubs wanted a place for self-study, as they were unable to sufficiently particpiate nor fare well in competitions. Clubs are often very niche, making it difficult to apply general knowledge.\n2. For students that had a few skills did not find motivation to come to classes as knowledge was often repeated.\n3. Students that had a lot of experience wanted to get ahead, but did not have the facilities to learn more content than what was taught to them in previous years.\n\n### Stage 3: Sample Platform\n\nFor our school's coding club, I wanted to build a platform where students could access stream-based content and upload coding solutions. While it never went live, it provided insights into:\n1. Make sure knowledge is available within a few clicks—if it takes too long to find information, then the knowledge does not hold the same value\n2. Segment and classify all information. Make sure that information is shared methodically.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221117180542.png]]\n\nWithin our school, platforms as such have changed the way that I understand the communication of information that — to me — often felt standard. I foresee this platform being used to streamline interactions within several schools \u0026 seeing new variations being deployed by young developers.\n\n---","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.024711566Z","tags":null},"/private/English/ARITS-Comparative-Essay":{"title":"ARITS - Comparative Essay","content":"\n#### Feminism\nFeminism is a perspective that views [gender](https://www.123helpme.com/topics/gender) as one of the most important bases of the structure and organization of the social world.

This response seeks to explore both texts from a Feminist lens, comparing and contrasting how each work depicts the global struggle of women’s education. Hansberry wrote A Raisin in the Sun at a time when she was facing a similar strife herself, allowing her to craft the story to meticulously reflect reality. The authenticity of the play encourages the audience to empathize with each character’s story, one of which being Beneatha’s difficulties with her education. Satrapi, similarly, presents the experiences she has gone through by narrating Persepolis as a coming-of-age story - commencing and ending with her time in educational institutions. Satrapi’s structuring of the graphic novel accentuates the pivotal role that education plays in Marji’s life; an emphasis is brought to how it is a common thread running through a myriad of her adversities. Throughout both texts, the theme of women’s struggle with education is explored through the symbolic portrayal of main characters and bookending structure.\n\nLorraine Hansberry curates each character in her play to represent a different facet of the African-American’s experience in America during the 1950’s, an example being Beneatha who symbolizes adversity, progression, and rebellion. A Raisin in the Sun spotlights a family of vastly different members, each undergoing their own journey and bound together by their shared financial situation. Beneatha, a Black woman who falls under two minority groups, is in college studying medicine - an anomaly in American society at the time of this play. The adversities she faces as a result of her identity are foreshadowed through her name, Beneatha, which is an extension of the word beneath. Names being an integral component of one’s identity, the rebellious character possessing a name with its origins in a word negatively connoted, sets the foundation for all the struggles she will face as a result of who she is. Furthermore, Hansberry distinguishes Beneatha’s character as one reflecting progression in societal thoughts and systems. This paves the way for a deeper exploration of how systemic structures - such as the geographical and financial inaccessibility of schools - bar women from attaining a standard level education. Additionally, Beneatha is shown as a fearless and outspoken woman through repeatedly delivering her dialogue in a tone of heightened urgency. By bringing attention to how strong Beneatha is, the audience is posed with the question of why it is necessary for her to display such ferocity; the failures of society in educating women - Black women specifically - are brought to light.\n\nMarjane Sitrapi’s structuring of the book, last chapter, and panels, brings emphasis to the role of education in Marji’s life. The story centers around Marji’s life in Iran during the Iranian Revolution, and how the violent and extremist climate impacted her childhood growing up. Seen in the first chapter, and once again in the last, is the fact that the receiving of a holistic education is denied to Marji and contributes to the strife in her life. By bookending the story with this common theme, Sitrapi draws attention to the tumultuous nature of her school years, further deepening the devastation evoked within readers. The emotive structure of the book allows for readers to empathize with the gravity of the issue Sitrapi depicts. Furthermore, the last chapter focuses on how Marji’s struggle with a censored curriculum forces her to leave the country entirely. The structure of the chapter is set so that it transitions from a massive fight between Marji and her teacher at the beginning, to the scene of her departure from her home. The effectiveness of this structure lies in its cause and effect transitions, where the readers see not only the struggles Marji faces in regards to her schooling, but also the repercussions of them; the message of her adversities is thus conveyed well through the specific authorial choice of choosing the last chapter to reflect a full circle moment with her education. Moreover, the specific panels within this chapter show resentment through the facial expressions of the characters, allowing readers to grasp the frustrations felt by Marji and the true depth of her struggles. The furrowed eyebrows depict an aggression that is seen both literally and figuratively. Each character in the scene is emotionally charged, heightening the risk associated with Marji’s rebellion against the educational institutions. In portraying the vitality of the moment through intense confrontations, Sitrapi efficiently infuses the story with a theme of women’s struggle in education.\n\nA Raisin in the Sun and Persepolis, both, depict the struggles with education that women face through the authors’ intentional character depictions and text structures. A common link shared between Beneatha and Marji is how their ambition creates a situation where they rebel against their community’s expectations. Beneatha does not listen to her family who is trying to persuade her to give up, and Marji does not listen to her school which is trying to convince her of the fallacy of her beliefs. Both characters desire to challenge the systems that limit them, and do so by continuing to tune the voice of their society out. Though Hansberry and Sitrapi share similarities in their portrayal of these characters, the foundation of which these stories are built, contrast greatly. A Raisin in the Sun revolves around the life of a family collectively, within the span of a few months - allowing readers to zone in on the microscale repercussions of Beneatha’s struggles with education. Meanwhile, Persepolis spans over a time period of around two decades; readers are able to grasp the larger consequences of Marji’s turbulent schooling. Thus, it can be seen that both A Raisin in the Sun and Persepolis, while being texts of entirely separate forms, convey the universality and pertinence of exploring women’s education and lack-there-of.","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.024711566Z","tags":null},"/private/English/Banksy-Relevant-Questions":{"title":"","content":"1.

One is by the sword. The other is by debt.”  - John Adams, 1826\n\n\nIn 1989, Chinese revolutionary leader Deng Xiaoping pioneered the nation’s rapid industrialization and transition from an agrarian society. His efforts in trade liberalization accelerated China’s economy to grow nearly 10% annually, join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and eventually become the largest economy by GDP in 2017. To this day, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) remains to be the largest growing economy, as well as being the only country to increase in GDP in 2020 after the outbreak of COVID-19. However, as an emerging superpower, China’s means of rapid growth has been put into question. Geostrategist Brahma Chellaney depicts China’s rapid industrialization as facilitated through high-volume debt to developing countries to gain sovereignty and geopolitical advantage. Chellaney coins this narrative as ‘debt-trap diplomacy’, highlighting a foreign policy approach that uses high levels of debt to blackmail countries into acceding to policy demands in favour of the benefactor. He claims that this debt is exchanged with increased industrialization projects and external sovereignty of resource-rich regions, notably northern Africa. The existence of this theory has been debated since its introduction in 2017, prompting me to investigate: to what extent has the evolution of Africa-China relations since 2013 discredited the presence of ‘debt-trap diplomacy’? \n\nInvestigating the existence of this theory, between the 2014 and 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflicts, can be explored through the lens of multilateralism, military intervention and the recovery from economic inflation. First, the western emphasis on sanctions significantly reduced support for African economic growth, opening new opportunities for multilateral trade between China and Africa. Initiatives like the Belt-Road and free trade agreements are demonstrative of China’s commitment to becoming an international power. Second, the African governments’ focus on sustainability compromised their internal sovereignty; Africa’s reliance on funding and resources have rapidly increased as a result of these conflicts, posing new opportunities for loans inflicted by Chinese governments. It is argued that military intervention through peacekeeping and peacebuilding are employed to create sustainable infrastructure for long-term development, instead of short-term debt traps. Finally, both Russia and Ukraine make up the majority of Africa’s wheat exports, thus creating worldwide food shortages and inflation during the war; as northern Africa’s resources deplete, their governments sought partnerships with the PRC. Here, strategies for economic sustainability were employed and debt was considered to be an inevitable consequence, instead of a political advantage. Ultimately, understanding these contexts allow for a stronger understanding of China’s sustainable and relational motivations in northern Africa.\n\nPower is the ability to activate change through authority and control, instead of being seen as a unitary force. This investigation is deeply connected to the concept of relational power, which is the relative power a nation-state has over another; this is indicative of a network of nations that interact in order to gain power. Instead of understanding it as material capacity, relational power emphasizes the way in which material resources are distributed. The fundamental tenet is that the material value of a nation, albeit military or economic, only has a value when there are multiple actors establishing a relationship surrounding its distribution. This provokes an investigation into whether China and Africa interact through a hierarchical dependency or a mutual relationship. \n\nThere are further connections to sustainability and peace. Sustainability, more specifically sustainable development, refers to advancements made to accelerate the present state of society without compromising the future. Development, analyzed through patterns of deprivation and measured through economic success, is influenced in the face of internal changes to political power and shifts in external sovereignty. In the context of trade liberalization and export orientation, the changes in development are indicative of the stability and relational success of a nation-state. Furthermore, peace is the absence of overt violence at internal and external settings through political systems, power distribution and diplomatic resolution. Here, positive peace investigates the measures that aim to sustain peace beyond the elimination of conflict; efforts to maintain this positive peace vary between social, military and economic means. Cumulatively, investigating China’s role in peacebuilding reflects their interest in maintaining a relationship with Africa, or whether this is an independent movement for rapid industrialization. \n\nTo evaluate the presence of debt-trap diplomacy, shifts in the knowledge economy, trade agreements and global metrics in the context of neoliberal theories will be representative of China’s influence in the sustainability of northern Africa. Further, UN peacemaking with international actors and peacekeeping interventions reflect China’s motivations in engaging with the continent during this time period. Analyzing both effects required primary and secondary sources, such that primary sources were found through interviews and perspectives. All possible sources of bias were considered and evaluated.\n\n## Power through Multilateralism to Globalize Trade\n\nThrough the use of multilateral interactions and deals, China’s government increased engagement with north African powers to enable continental initiatives for trade and retain regional power. The 2014 and 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflicts, which have instigated military and political realignments, weakened the western domination of African affairs and introduced new possibilities for multilateral cooperation between China and north Africa. Smart power measures by the European Union and United States eroded the Russian government’s ability to finance a war, including economic, cyber and geopolitical sanctions every year since 2014, culminating to 663 personal sanctions on Russian oligarchs and 729 multilateral sanctions. With the influx of foreign sanctions, however, the United States and other western powers prioritized breaking ties with primary forces involved in the attack and, by extension, strained their foreign relations with critical markets such as Africa. In 2014, following the first Russia-Ukraine conflict, US trade with Sub-Saharan Africa reduced from USD $75B to USD $25B, the petroleum market decreased six-fold and African exports surpassed American exports for the first time in the 21st century. As mentioned by political economist David Ricardo, nations that “...lost part of [their] trade, could not retain the same quantity of circulating medium which it before possessed.” The Western emphasis on sanctions limited their relational power with African markets, thus opening new opportunities for Chinese trade through multilateralism, as illustrated through recent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) metrics.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/x8mFOWcJosV8gX6gK39E4TgT571YCyiW7rBXk816s_dY-QlN55t-X3SbXnSLw9m9oCqc-1ElVHbCgcmOf7msfmFKf6KfhIw8ZBWNffFlZZn5l1INhZp1Rnb5-6cNqrQiEThQ2v0nXWNftgSzwwxFu3u-gP8YiyNinTU6t_cP25VHH0e-xQv1WUu5STuHsw)\n\nFigure 1: \n\nDebt-trap diplomacy claims that China drastically increased engagement with Africa to implement high-scale infrastructure at a low cost; the lack of Western involvement in African countries following the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict put Africa’s globalization at risk, resulting in high volume loans by China. However, President of the PRC Xi Jinping claims that the majority of the world’s problems are not rooted in overly integrated economies, but rather the lack of economic globalization. To restore Africa’s role on the global stage, China drastically increased their multilateral involvement with Sub-Saharan communities to promote sustainable development, instead of accumulating debt. Both nations, as signatories of the Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation, are part of the ‘community of states’ that demonstrate their commitment in supporting the ‘third world’. The first signs of change in Africa emerged in 2015, when the president of the African Union (AU) launched a ‘golden era’ of relations. In this time, an influx of bilateral trade between the nations emerged, which was representative of mutual growth, not hierarchical dependency. The most prominent example during this period has been the onset of the Belt Road Initiative, the emergence of a trans-Asia network of trade routes spanning for 6400 kilometers that was representative of relational power through the shared power of resources to aim in globalization. This initiative discredits the existence of debt trap diplomacy through two factors. First, as senior economist S.M. Shafaeddin mentions, trade liberalization is the act that would neutralize a trade regime beyond the scope of government intervention. He extends this argument through export orientation\n\nIn light of this new opportunity, China drastically increased engagement with Africa to implement high-scale infrastructure at a low cost; the lack of Western engagement enabled the formation of loans for development throughout the continent. The China Africa Research Initiative, a study completed by the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in 2021, spotlights the inverse relationship between Chinese FDI and US FDI to Africa following a point of influx between 2012 and 2014.\n\n**","lastmodified":"2022-12-04T05:55:08.024711566Z","tags":null}}
